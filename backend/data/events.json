In this presentation, I argue that much of what we think we \u201cknow\u201d about racial profiling is wrong. Popular definitions of the term \u201cracial profiling\u201d are much too narrow or too vague, and, in this way, they are wrong. I contend prevailing thought on the causes of racial profiling as residing within individuals is deeply flawed and leads to interventions that will be ineffective such as implicit bias training. I demonstrate that racial profiling is not primarily a problem of biased cognitions; instead, racial profiling is caused by remediable structural factors that are beyond the control of individual officers patrolling American streets. These structural factors motivate police officers to take racially biased actions and facilitate racial profiling by providing legally defensible shields to conceal biased actions. The recognition of the true causes of racial profiling combined with technological innovations in policing lead to real-world solutions that could end racial profiling.\u00a0", "endtime": "01:00 PM", "event_id": "", "event_index": 69, "location": "395 McNeil Building\u00a0\n3718 Locust Walk\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Dapartment of Criminology", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "summary": "", "title": "Criminology Colloquium Series: Ojmarrh Mitchell", "url": "https://crim.sas.upenn.edu/events/criminology-colloquium-series-ojmarrh-mitchell"},

However, establishing a tight link between these allocation patterns and firm conduct has been difficult because there exist cost-based explanations that can generate these allocation patterns under competition. Focusing on the set of auctions in which the winning bid and the losing bids are very close, we use ideas similar to regression discontinuity design to distinguish between allocation patterns that simply reflect cost differences across firms and those that are indicative of collusion. We derive conditions under which our test has correct size under the null of competition. Applying our test to the sample of municipal auctions in Japan, we find evidence of collusion among the set of procurement auctions whose winning bid is relatively high.Keywords: Procurement, Collusion, Backlog, Incumbency, Regression Discontinuity, Regulation. * Corresponding author: kei@berkeley.edu. We thank Frank Wolak for helpful comments on an early draft. We also thank seminar audiences at Duke, Northwestern, and Berkeley-Paris Organizational Economics Workshop for helpful comments.\n1The ability of competition authorities to proactively detect and punish collusion is crucial for achieving the goal of promoting and maintaining competition. Not only do the possibility of detection and prosecution serve as strong deterrents against collusion, they also affect the incentives of firms in existing cartels to apply for leniency programs. Successful identification of cartels thus deters collusive activity and complements the effectiveness of leniency programs.In the absence of concrete leads, using screens to flag suspicious firm conduct can be useful for regulators as a first step in identifying collusion. While screens cannot substitute for direct evidence of collusion such as testimonies and records of communication, they can provide guidance on which markets or firms to focus investigation. A growing number of agencies are adopting screens that use algorithms to flag suspicious behavior using bidding data from public procurement auctions.1 In fact, there are a number of cases in which investigation was initiated on the basis of screens alone, and, ultimately, resulted in successful cartel prosecution.2 The results from screens can also be used in court to obtain warrants or authorization for a more intrusive investigation. They can be used in court for civil antitrust litigation and private litigation as well.\n3Screening of cartels can also be useful to those outside of antitrust authorities. For example, screening can help procurement offices counter suspected bidding rings by more aggressively soliciting new bidders or adopting auction mechanisms that are less susceptible to collusion. Screening may also be helpful for internal auditors and compliance officers of complicit firms to identify collusion and help contain potential exposure from it.In this paper, we propose a way to test for collusion using one of the most commonly 1 Competition authorities that use statistical analysis or algorithms to screen for collusion include those in Brazil, South Korea, Switzerland and United Kingdom.

In countries with large declining agricultural sectors, aggregate employment is uncorrelated with GDP. During booms, employment in agriculture declines while labor productivity increases in agriculture more than in other sectors. We construct a unified theory of business cycles and structural change consistent with the stylized facts. The focal point of the theory is the simultaneous decline and modernization of agriculture. As capital accumulates, agriculture becomes increasingly capital intensive as modern agriculture crowds out traditional agriculture. Structural change accelerates in booms and slows down in recessions.

We call such acquisitions \"killer acquisitions.\" We develop a parsimonious model illustrating this phenomenon. Using pharmaceutical industry data, we show that acquired drug projects are less likely to be developed when they overlap with the acquirer's existing product portfolio, especially when the acquirer's market power is large due to weak competition or distant patent expiration. Conservative estimates indicate about 6% of acquisitions in our sample are killer acquisitions. These acquisitions disproportionately occur just below thresholds for antitrust scrutiny.JEL Classification: O31, L41, G34, L65", "endtime": "5:00pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 119, "location": "PCPSE Room 100 \n          United States", "owner": "Department of Economics", "speaker": "Florian Ederer\n\n      Yale University", "starttime": "3:30pm", "summary": "", "title": "Killer Acquisitions *", "url": "https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/events/killer-acquisitions"},

The FLM generalizes Luce's model and naturally captures bounded rationality models while behaviorally distinguishing between what is focal and the magnitude of the bias due to focality. We show how to identify utilities, focal sets, and bias terms from choice frequencies and behaviorally found the FLM with two weakenings of independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA) which account for the decision maker's revealed focus. We introduce a new condition on focal sets, Conditionally Decreasing, which captures an increasing difficulty of focusing on multiple alternative and encompasses several models of limited consideration. We apply our model to experimental data, illustrate the importance of accounting for focus in demand estimation, and propose a simple method to identify focal sets.", "endtime": "5:30pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 120, "location": "PCPSE Room TBD \n          United States", "owner": "Department of Economics", "speaker": "Matthew Kovach\n\n      Virginia Tech", "starttime": "4:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "The Focal Luce Model *", "url": "https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/events/focal-luce-model"},

My argument is in three parts. The first focuses on the rise of mathematically based astrology in 5th- and 4th-century Babylon. I suggest that, after a period of resistance against Persian rule under Darius and Xerxes, Chaldean astrology emerged from a new climate of collaboration and assimilation under the later Achaemenids. I then look at developments after the fall of the Persian empire: Seleucus of Seleucia (ca. 150 BCE), I argue, exemplifies a period of exceptionally fertile intellectual crosspollination, when leading Chaldeans drew on Babylonian datasets and observational techniques to intervene in Greek philosophical debates. The final part of my paper addresses the crisis of Chaldean philosophy that resulted from the rise of Platonism, and its remodeling along Platonic lines in the Antonine period.\n", "endtime": "6:00pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 162, "location": "402 Cohen Hall", "owner": "Department of Classical Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "4:30pm", "summary": "", "title": "COLLOQUIUM: Johannes Haubold, Princeton, \"The development of Chaldean philosophy between the fifth century BCE and the second century CE\"", "url": "https://www.classics.upenn.edu/events/colloquium-johannes-haubold-princeton-development-chaldean-philosophy-between-fifth-century"},

HCV-related stigma has been identified as an important and understudied barrier to HCV care. Stigma is a social-process, linking individual attributes/behaviors to negative stereotypes. Stigma in healthcare is associated with poor health outcomes and decreased quality of life. Moreover, healthcare stigmas may intersect with stigmas of other personal attributes, intensifying patient experiences of disease-related stigma and social marginalization. To date, no validated and standardized instrument exists to measure perceptions of stigma among patients with chronic HCV infection, limiting efforts to identify, measure, and intervene upon the impact of stigma. To address existing knowledge gaps, we conducted an explanatory mixed-methods study across five Philadelphia healthcare clinics to: 1) revise and validate the Berger HIV Stigma Scale- a validated HIV stigma measure- for use among patients with HCV; 2) identify factors associated with HCV-related stigma; and 3) connect subjective experience of HCV-related stigma to HCV Stigma Scale (HCV-SS) scores. Our mixed-methods approach included a cross-sectional survey instrument (n=270) and semi-structured interviews among a subset of participants (n=23) who completed the survey instrument. We evaluated the validity of the HCV-SS using factor analysis and item response theory. Analyses evidenced a unidimensional factor solution, yielding a 33-item scale with good reliability (\uf061=0.957) and construct validity. Qualitative content validity analyses identified additional salient themes that inform HCV-related stigma experiences, chiefly familial support and associated injection drug-use stigma. We then used multivariable linear regression to analyze associations among HCV-related stigma and hypothesized demographic, behavioral, and clinical determinants. We hypothesized that additional stigmatized attributes, such as HIV coinfection and history of injection drug use, may augment experiences of HCV-related stigma. We found that most participants experienced stigma associated with their HCV diagnosis. Determinants of HCV-related stigma differed substantially between HCV-monoinfected and HCV/HIV-coinfected participants. The generation of a validated and standardized scale to measure HCV-related stigma and identify determinants improves understandings of stigma experienced by patients with HCV-infection, which can inform interventions to increase rates of HCV diagnosis and treatment.\u00a0\n\n\nDissertation Advisors: Vincent Lo Re, III, MD, MSCE\u00a0\n\n\nCommittee Chair: John Holmes, PhD, FACE, FACMI\u00a0\n\n\nCommittee: Fran Barg, PhD, MeD, Nandita Mitra, PhD, Julie Szymczak, PhD, Jason Schnittker, PhD", "endtime": " 1:00pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 261, "location": "Class of 62\u2019 Auditorium, John Morgan Building, 3620 Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00pm ", "summary": "", "title": "GGEB Dissertation Defense: M.

Available information in this scenario commonly includes longitudinal measurements from the same subject. Since future information is unknown and may develop dynamically over time, such a predictive problem is challenging. We consider a predictive approach based on modeling the forward intensity function. The forward intensity function approach is appealing for being capable of intrinsically incorporating the future dynamics that affect the stochastic event occurrence. To handle the practical difficulty due to the missing data in the longitudinal measurements, and to accommodate observations at irregularly spaced time points, we propose a smoothed composite likelihood approach for estimating the forward intensity model. Our theoretical analysis establishes the validity of the predictive modeling approach and the smoothed composite likelihood method. Extensive simulations and real data analysis demonstrate the promising performance of the predictive approach.

A long-standing problem with such regression analyses is the lack of effective diagnostic tools for validating model assumptions. The difficulty arises from the fact that an ordinal variable has discrete values that are labeled with, but not, numerical values. The values merely represent ordered categories. In this paper, we propose a surrogate approach to defining residuals for an ordinal outcome Y. The idea is to define a continuous variable S as a \u201csurrogate\u201d of Y and then obtain residuals based on S. For the general class of cumulative link regression models, we study the residual\u2019s theoretical and graphical properties. We show that the residual has null properties similar to those of the common residuals for continuous outcomes. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the residual has power to detect misspecification with respect to 1) mean structures; 2) link functions; 3) heteroscedasticity; 4) proportionality; and 5) mixed populations. The proposed residual also enables us to develop numeric measures for goodness-of-fit using classical distance notions. Our results suggest that compared to a previously defined residual, our residual can reveal deeper insights into model diagnostics. We stress that this work focuses on residual analysis, rather than hypothesis testing. The latter has limited utility as it only provides a single p-value, whereas our residual can reveal what components of the model are mis specified and advise how to make improvements.\n\n\n  This is a joint work with Dungang Liu, University of Cincinnati Lindner College of Business.", "endtime": " 4:30pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 264, "location": "701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "3:30pm ", "summary": "", "title": "Biostatistics Seminar Series - Heping Zhang, PhD", "url": "http://events.med.upenn.edu/cceb/#!view/event/event_id/710452"},

The biases from intermittent observation of time-dependent covariates\u00a0will also be considered along with a multistate approach to mitigating this bias through joint modeling. Two applications will illustrate the benefits of joint modeling disease and observation processes.", "endtime": " 4:30pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 266, "location": "701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "3:30pm ", "summary": "", "title": "Biostatistics Seminar Series - Richard J.

The day-long workshop will consist of four thematically-organized sessions, each comprised of 2-3 presenters and a discussant. Each presenter need only offer a\u00a0brief\u00a0overview of the paper (~5 minutes), to be followed by the discussant\u2019s short, detailed comments on all the papers (~15 minutes). The majority of each session will be devoted to discussion open to all the participants.\u00a0We expect all participants to have read the papers before the workshop, so that workshop discussions on the day can be as fruitful and productive as possible.\nCHAIR offers an opportunity to build a community of young IR scholars who study China, and there will be ample time for socializing throughout the day. In addition to inter-session breaks, a catered lunch will be provided and, at the workshop\u2019s conclusion, we will be pleased to host dinner at a local restaurant for further conversation in a more casual setting. CHAIR thus represents an excellent opportunity for academic enrichment and professional networking. To see past workshop participants and papers, please visit our\u00a0Facebook page. We look forward to receiving your submissions.\nSincerely,\nRachel Hulvey, Clara Lee, and Alina Zheng\n\nAbstract Submission Instructions\nAbstracts are due by\u00a011:59p.m. USEDT, Friday, September 6,2019.\nThere are two components to a submission:\n1.

Can China and the United States avoid the Thucydides Trap as China rises?\u00a0\u00a0Allison\u2019s study leads one to conclude that such is not likely.\u00a0\u00a0Highlighting the importance of a number of different/additional variables than Allison\u2019s study focuses on, the analysis offered in this talk is not much more optimistic.\u00a0\u00a0It highlights eight reasons China and the US will find it difficult to avoid the Thucydides Trap: the bilateral strategic trust deficit, lack of agreement on the nature of the US pivot and US Indo-Pacific Strategy, recent trends in China\u2019s maritime policies, disagreements over cyber security, the US-China trade row, security dynamics underlying China\u2019s Anti-Access/Area Denial and Washington\u2019s AirSea Battle strategies, recent trends in Sino-Russian strategic alignment, and Washington\u2019s concerns about China\u2019s increased defense spending and growing military capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Moore argues that these eight factors will make it difficult to avoid a Sino-US conflict (hot or cold) in the coming decade, while leaving more room for the role of agency, or good diplomacy, than does Allison\u2019s approach.\nGregory J.

Wary of these dangers, China\u2019s national leaders have tried to forestall top-heavy urbanization. However, urban and regional development policies at the subnational level have not always followed suit.\u00a0China\u2019s Urban Champions\u00a0explores the development paths of different provinces and asks why policymakers in many cases favor big cities in a way that reinforces spatial inequalities rather than reducing\u00a0them.\nKyle Jaros combines in-depth case studies of Hunan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Jiangsu provinces with quantitative analysis to shed light on the political drivers of uneven development. Drawing on numerous Chinese-language written sources, including government documents and media reports, as well as a wealth of field interviews with officials, policy experts, urban planners, academics, and businesspeople, Jaros shows how provincial development strategies are shaped by both the horizontal relations of competition among different provinces and the vertical relations among different tiers of government. Metropolitan-oriented development strategies advance when lagging economic performance leads provincial leaders to fixate on boosting regional competitiveness, and when provincial governments have the political strength to impose their policy priorities over the objections of other\u00a0actors.\nRethinking the politics of spatial policy in an era of booming growth,\u00a0China\u2019s Urban Champions\u00a0highlights the key role of provincial units in determining the nation\u2019s metropolitan and regional development\u00a0trajectory.\nKyle A. Jaros is Associate Professor in the Political Economy of China at the University of Oxford and a Visiting Fellow at the University of Notre Dame's Liu Institute for Asia and Asian Studies (2019-2020).

The 3-D printing process builds a three-dimensional object from a computer-aided design model by adding material, such as liquid resin or powder grains being fused together, layer by layer. This process is also known as additive manufacturing. In the early 1990s, 3-D printing techniques were considered suitable only for the production of functional or aesthetic prototypes. Fast-forward 30 years, and the speed, precision, repeatability, and material range have increased to the point that 3-D printing processes are now used in commercial industrial production. One of the key advantages of 3-D printing is the ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries directly without need for a mold. Thus the technology also lends itself to mass customization, where items, such as running shoes, can be customized to an individual\u2019s needs. Turner will discuss advances in the basic understanding of mechanical design of materials and components made via additive manufacturing. Liu will detail some of the state-of-the-art developments in additive manufacturing for the industrial scale; he has spent the last few years developing polymeric materials specifically for this application.

Italian merchants in 17th century Amsterdam\" \n(see abstract below)\nIt'll take place in Cherpack at 5:15 on Thursday Oct. 24. We hope to see many of you at this event.\n***\nABSTRACT\nEver since Genoese galleys had made their appearance at Bruges in the last quarter of the 13th century, communities of Italian long distance traders had been residing in the Low Countries. In the 16th century, most of them lived in Antwerp, then the commercial metropolis of the Low Countries. However, by the end of that century political and religious turmoil and climatological and demographic transformations had radically altered the trade patterns between the two regions. In 1585, Dutch rebels closed off Antwerp\u2019s access to the sea. Moreover, large parts of Italy became dependent upon the import of grains from the North. Therefore, by the 1590s many Italian merchants had left Antwerp. Subsequently, some of them, mostly Protestant Lucchese bankers, established themselves in Amsterdam.\n\u00a0In the final phases of the Thirty Years war a second wave of Italian migrants joined them. These new migrants mostly stemmed from humbler backgrounds. Moreover, they originated from provincial towns and not from commercial hubs such as Venice or Florence. Silvio Tensini, from Crema in Lombardy and his son in law Francesco Feroni, from Empoli in Tuscany were examples in point. In this lecture, I shall highlight the career of the latter.\n\u00a0Originally, Feroni concentrated on the import of Baltic grains to Italy, for which he established a network that stretched from Archangel in Russia, over Hamburg and Amsterdam to ports along the Tyrrhenian coast, such as Genoa, Livorno or Civitavecchia. Subsequently, he diversified his business and he started to import Spanish wools to the Netherlands and to export Dutch books, scientific instruments and works of art to Italy. Finally, he engaged in the triangular trade across the Atlantic in slaves and sugar. Moreover, Feroni acted as an information broker and an officious representative of the Medici Grand Dukes in the Dutch Republic. Within two decades, he became one of Amsterdam\u2019s wealthiest merchants.\nIn contrast to the first wave of immigrants, Feroni and his peers remained staunch Catholics. Thanks to his Roman contacts, he became an influential figure in the local Catholic minority community and he advocated its interests with the Protestant urban magistrate. Although it seems that Feroni never learnt Dutch, he thus was relatively well integrated.\nFrom the 1660s onward, a third wave of Italian migration followed suit. In response to the aggressive policies of King Louis XIV, Florentine bankers and merchants gradually withdrew from Paris and settled in Amsterdam. They stimulated a new increase both in the maritime and in the overland trade between the Dutch Republic and various Italian states. However, from the 1670s until the early 18th century, the Dutch economy entered a phase of stagnation and by then Amsterdam attracted less foreign merchants. In the 18th century, most Italian immigrants to the Dutch Republic would be artisans instead of merchants.\nFrancesco Feroni\u2019s extra-ordinary career testifies from the dynamic character of the Italian trade during an age in which the economy of the peninsula stagnated. His activities fit into a broader pattern and therefore it is worthwhile to analyze them.", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 383, "location": "Cherpack Seminar Room - 543 Williams Hall", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "summary": "", "title": "Hans Cools (Brueghel Visiting Professor at Penn) on Italians in Early Modern Amsterdam (Cherpack)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2019/10/hans-cools-brueghel-visiting-professor-penn-italians-early-modern-amsterdam-cherpack"},

We look forward to seeing many of you at this talk!\n\u00a0\n*****\nWhen Richard Wagner created a lowered orchestra pit at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in the 1870s he famously described the decision in terms of concealment; an attempt to hide the means of sound production. In view of the modifications made to numerous opera houses in the decades that followed to create similar orchestra pits, scholars have tended to assume that the Festspielhaus was both the stimulus and model for such spaces. If this tends to flatten out important variations in architectural design between theaters, it also narrates the introduction of orchestra pits from the perspective of audience members alone. While lowered orchestral platforms might have functioned as so-called \u201cmystical chasms\u201d from which sound floated upwards towards awed spectators, these also had a crucial role in the creation of enclosed, protected spaces for musicians.\nThe 1907 construction of the so-called \u201cgolfo mistico\u201d at the preeminent Teatro alla Scala in Milan, under the supervision of Arturo Toscanini, was to a considerable extent an experiment in the creation of a more professional atmosphere than performance at audience level allowed. However much the term golfo mistico betrays a Romantic conception of the space, it was not, I argue, coincidental that the pit was constructed in the same moment that trade unions for musicians were establishing themselves. Meanwhile, musicians were also becoming familiar with other sorts of enclosures calibrated to control acoustics and eliminate distractions, in the form of the earliest sound studios. Placing La Scala\u2019s golfo mistico in the context of these dual developments in the Italian music industry at the time, I reveal the extent of the orchestra pit\u2019s entanglements in a musical landscape which increasingly placed musicians at one remove from their audiences; in tandem, I offer a new framework in which to make sense of the new (and enduring) fashion for this architectural innovation.", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 385, "location": "Music Building, Lerner Center 101", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "Prof. Laura Protano-Biggs", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "summary": "", "title": "Laura Protano-Biggs on the Teatro alla Scala in Milan (Music Building)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2019/11/laura-protano-biggs-teatro-alla-scala-milan-music-building"},

The rigorous Scholastic style of thirteenth-century treatises began to be replaced with more cryptic styles, most notably by the use of vivid metaphorical language, often of a theological nature, that gradually transformed a practical art into a seemingly sanctified form of knowledge. One figure in this transformation is the radical Franciscan from the Auvergne John of Rupescissa--part-time alchemist and full-time prophet. He saw alchemy as a means to restore the Church following the imminent arrival and subsequent defeat of the Antichrist.

In 1760, six slaves submitted a confession and plea for mercy to the magistrate of Wuding Prefecture, Yunnan, the immediate superior of their dead master, Nuo Jiayou, a N\u00e9 (or Yi) native chieftain. The slaves had been caught, terrifyingly, between two factions struggling over who would succeed their master as the sole owner of all the lands and peoples within his extensive domain. Their plaint, which named the slaves as its collective author, was written in Chinese, a language they could neither speak nor write. This paper traces their footsteps as they followed their master\u2019s widow to the prefectural capital and found a translator and a cut-rate litigation master to fashion their plaint. I show how the slaves\u2019 own form of spatial literacy, developed through service in their master\u2019s house and participation in his rituals, may have helped them read and navigate the unfamiliar city. Thinking through the specificities of how slaves became writers and readers also helps better delineate the shape of slavery in Ne\u0301 places, which became the designated \u201cslave societies\u201d of Chinese social science despite ubiquitous slavery in every region and economic sector of the Empire. I argue that the native chieftain system itself became a system of bondage in Qing society, confining Ne\u0301 and other \u2018non-Chinese\u2019 to mountain enclaves while extracting their wealth and using their lives in military actions.\nErik Mueggler is Katherine Verdery Collegiate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Law enforcement representatives instead push family members to settle problems on their own. Given such a context, this presentation explores how law and legal norms impact relationships between parents and children after divorce. All dynamics of post-divorce kinship begin from the legal fact that there is no joint custody in Japan. Throughout the postwar, rates of custody being granted to mothers have steadily increased, and currently stand at eighty percent. Moreover sole legal custody is coupled with a cultural belief that a \u201cclean break\u201d can benefit children because it is psychologically less damaging to have no contact with one parent than shuttle between two households. However there is a growing movement, organized mostly by non-custodial fathers, to \u201creform\u201d Japanese family law and popularize a joint custody option. This presentation focuses on both people who experienced a \u201cclean break\u201d divorce and those who are increasingly calling that disconnection into question. I argue that although there are no requirements for shared custody, a substantial minority of families sustain de facto joint custody. Demonstrating contested, shifting ideals of familial bonds, these attempts to share custody highlight desires to redress the disconnection divorce produces and to create connected families, even when they bring legal risks.\nAllison Alexy\u00a0is an assistant professor in the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures and Department of Women\u2019s Studies at the University of Michigan.

The first expansion of humans \u2013 Homo erectus- began 2.4 \u2013 1.8 million ago. The second expansion, this time of Homo sapiens sapiens, reached China between 85,000 and 80,000 BP. The expansion of speakers of Austronesian languages, returned to Africa, reaching Madagascar in the early centuries of the present era. The diffusion of domesticated plants, like bananas, from New Guinea to South Asia and Africa and dated to the mid-fourth millennium in Uganda and mid-first millennium BCE in southern Cameroon, provide additional evidence of interactions between Africa and Asia. Africa and Asia have long been in regular contact, through land and seas. \nHis paper will explore different facets of these Africa-Asia connections using glimpses gleaned from our ongoing archaeological research on the Island of Manda in Kenya, where we have unearthed excellent archaeological remains of the existence of trade between Africa and China.

This article seeks to restore Ch\u2019\u014fn\u2019s centrality as a Buddhist modernizer, thereby ultimately bringing balance to a largely monastic-centered and nationalist history and lengthening the lineage of lay female leadership in the transformation of Korean Buddhism in the beginning of the twentieth century.\n", "endtime": "01:00 PM", "event_id": "", "event_index": 418, "location": "", "owner": "Center for East Asian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "Korean Studies Colloquium \"Restoring Buddhism to Seoul: Court Lady Ch\u2019\u014fn\u2019s Influence in Modernizing Korean Buddhism\"", "url": "https://ceas.sas.upenn.edu/events/korean-studies-colloquium-restoring-buddhism-seoul-court-lady-ch%E2%80%99%C5%8Fn%E2%80%99s-influence-modernizing"},

They grew especially alarmed at the growing power the government was giving to psychiatrists to oversee the psychological wellbeing of Americans. Using the state\u2019s police powers, they feared, liberals would soon declare anti-communists and other conservatives mentally ill and banish them to mental institutions. Two events in the 1950s brought these anxieties to a fever pitch: the involuntary confinement of Vermont anti-communist activist Lucille Miller to a federal psychiatric hospital and federal legislation to fund the construction of a mental hospital in the Alaska territory.\n  In their campaigns to free Miller and stop the construction of what they believed would be an Alaskan gulag, these activists turned to the law. They argued that the Constitution safeguarded a vision of liberty as the absence of unwanted government intrusions into an individual\u2019s life. While these ultraconservative activists were dismissed as crackpots, many of their critics also felt a sense of diminished autonomy in the postwar world. In subsequent decades, they too would grow wary of government paternalism and embrace, for various reasons, a more libertarian understanding of rights. This idea of rights would eclipse an alternative vision of them as a tool for pursuing collective, egalitarian ends. To our growing body of explanations about how communitarian possibilities for civil rights and civil liberties were \u201clost\u201d or \u201ctamed\u201d in the middle of the twentieth century, we might add anxieties about the fragility of the individual mind, which the cultural life of the Cold War drove to unprecedented levels.", "endtime": "1:20 PM", "event_id": "60767", "event_index": 432, "location": "Faculty Lounge", "owner": "Law School", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "summary": "", "title": "Legal History Workshop: Daniel LaChance, Emory University", "url": "https://www.law.upenn.edu/newsevents/calendar.php#event_id/60767/view/event"},

    {"date": "November 5, 2018", "date_dt": "05-11-2018", "description": "Professor Hirota\u2019s current book project, \u201cThe Business of the Nation: Foreign Contract Labor and the Rise of American Immigration Control,\u201d examines the transnational business of importing Asian, Canadian, European, and Mexican contract laborers to the United States and the evolution of federal alien contract labor law designed to restrict this form of immigration over the course of the long nineteenth century. Since the early nineteenth century, Americans opposed the immigration of poor foreign workers who would degrade the dignity of labor and lower American wage standards. The opposition to immigrant labor became especially strong in the case of contract workers. In 1885, American workers\u2019 antipathy to \u201calien contract labor\u201d resulted in the passage of the federal Foran Act to ban the landing of foreign contract workers and deport those already in the United States back to their countries of origin. This project examines how hostility toward contract labor migration influenced American immigration law and how the alien contract labor law in turn affected immigrant workers.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  The paper traces the intellectual and legal genealogy of alien contract labor law by surveying the antebellum roots of opposition to imported labor in the United States. While labor radicalism in the late nineteenth century played a crucial role in the introduction of the Foran Act, the federal law was built upon earlier discourses on servile labor and the economic impact on Americans of immigration of certain kinds. In particular, the paper identifies the following four issues in antebellum America as the ideological and legal origins of the alien contract labor law: 1) Free Soilism, 2) \u201cpauper labor\u201d discourse, 3) assisted emigration, and 4) coolieism. The analysis in this paper is not intended to provide new evidence or revise historiography on these topics. Instead, the paper aims to demonstrate how the antebellum debates over the four issues collectively, if not exclusively, laid the foundations for the federal alien contract labor law, placing it in the broader framework of immigration politics beyond the labor conflict in the late nineteenth century.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Hidetaka Hirota is a non-tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Institute for Advanced Study at Waseda University in Japan.

The rapidly rising divorce rate created a widespread crisis among women who had relied on their husbands for economic support and access to social insurance benefits such as Social Security and health insurance. In reponse, a now-forgotten strand of the 1970s feminist movement, which I call \u201cthe feminist divorce reform movement,\u201d emerged and organized itself around securing women\u2019s place in the United States\u2019 marriage-based insurance system. This paper, part of a larger project on this movement, examines divorce\u2019s decreasing political salience as more and more women entered the permanent workforce. In the 1970s, one-third of married American women were in the paid labor force. By 1985 that number had shot up. Even women with young children were now as likely to be found in the workforce as at home: around 50 percent of mothers with children under three and roughly 70 percent of mothers with children over six were in the labor force. In response, feminists who had once focused on shoring up the marriage-based insurance system turned their efforts toward securing women\u2019s place in the employment-based insurance system. In this paper I consider how legislative battles over the Family and Medical Leave Act, universal child care, and welfare reform fit into a longer history of feminist activism dedicated to creating a social insurance system that protected women from the economic vulnerabilities created by their carework obligations.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Suzanne Kahn received her Ph.D. in American History from Columbia University in 2015.

By measuring periodic\u00a0shifts in stellar spectral lines as a star and its planets orbit around\u00a0the system center of mass, \u201cexoplanets\u201d can be discovered. In some\u00a0cases, the masses of these planets can even be directly measured. These\u00a0measurements allow us to probe the internal compositions of these newly\u00a0discovered worlds, constrain models of planet formation, and put future\u00a0direct measurements of planets\u2019 atmospheric properties into context.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past three decades, advances in technology have made it\u00a0possible to achieve 1 m/s velocity precision in the measurements of\u00a0Sun-like stars. However, if we hope to detect analogs of terrestrial\u00a0planets like those in our solar system orbiting Sun-like stars, velocity\u00a0precision will need to improve substantially. Earth induces just a 10\u00a0cm/s wobble in the Sun. Understanding a host of astrophysical and\u00a0instrumental noise sources becomes important for measuring stellar\u00a0velocities with a precision below 1 m/s. I will describe NEID and MINERVA-Red, two new instruments that my team here at Penn helped build,\u00a0which are designed to push the limits of ground-based Doppler\u00a0measurement precision and open up new scientific opportunities in\u00a0exoplanet detection and characterization.", "endtime": "5:00pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 453, "location": "", "owner": "Department of Physics and Astronomy", "speaker": "Cullen Blake (University of Pennsylvania", "starttime": "4:05pm", "summary": "", "title": "Physics and Astronomy Colloquium: \"Finding Other Earths \u2013 New Frontiers in Exoplanet Science with Next-Generation Doppler Spectrometers\"", "url": "https://www.physics.upenn.edu/events/physics-and-astronomy-colloquium-finding-other-earths-new-frontiers-exoplanet-science-next"},

Rubbers and rocks can remember the largest loading applied to them; glasses may remember their past relaxation; shape-memory alloys remember a programmed shape. Many more examples exist in physics, biology, and chemistry. Despite the ubiquity of memory formation in condensed matter, there is presently no overarching framework for categorizing and describing such material memories. I will describe a budding effort to change this [1]. After an overview of several known memory behaviors, I will describe some qualitative connections and tentative classifications that attempt to bring together disparate systems. I will pay particular attention to an unusual kind of memory where learning and forgetting are intertwined, observed in sheared non-Brownian suspensions, traveling charge-density waves, and a model of a worn path.

The vast journey of blue moves from Hebrew ritual uses of snail pigments to the chemistry and economics of blue jean dyes.\nAmerican chemist Roald Hoffmann is widely known for using quantum mechanics to help reveal the mechanisms of chemical reactions. He was born Roald Safran in 1937 in a small Polish town that is now part of the Ukraine. Hoffmann's father was a civil engineer familiar with the local infrastructure, which made him of value to the Nazis. For a while the family was allowed to remain in its own home, but was later relocated to a labor camp, where many of the Nazi guards could be bribed. After being paid off, the guards allowed 5-year-old Roald, his mother, two aunts, and an uncle to escape in early 1943. A Ukrainian couple hid them in the attic and storeroom of a nearby schoolhouse where the husband taught. Hoffmann's father remained behind in the camp, where he was tortured and killed by the Nazis in June 1943 for his involvement in a plot to arm camp prisoners.After the war ended, Hoffmann and his mother relocated to New York, where he later won a Westinghouse science scholarship to Columbia University, earning his BA there. He took his doctorate in chemistry from Harvard and in 1965 began teaching chemistry at Cornell, where he is now Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters Emeritus. Since 2002, Hoffmann has hosted a monthly cabaret called \"Entertaining Science\" at Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9 in Greenwich Village.In 1963 Hoffmann introduced the extended H\u00fcckel method, a molecular orbital theory that allows calculation of the electronic structure of molecules. In 1965, in collaboration with Nobel laureate Robert Burns Woodward, he introduced the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a method for exploring the electronic structure of transition states and intermediates in organic reactions. Hoffmann and Japanese chemist Kenichi Fukui shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1981 for their theories, developed independently, concerning the course of chemical reactions (Woodward had died two years earlier and thus was ineligible).Hoffmann is also a published poet, playwright, and essayist. His poems appear in several collections: The Metamict State (1987), Gaps and Verges (1990), Memory Effects (1999), and Soliton (2002). In addition, he is a philosopher of science who has made significant contributions to our conceptual, historical, and normative understanding of chemistry. Many of his philosophical essays have been collected in Roald Hoffman on the Philosophy, Art, and Science of Chemistry by Jeffrey Kovac and Michael Weisberg, eds. (2012).", "endtime": "6:30pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 487, "location": "Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "The Allure of Indigo", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/allure-indigo"},

Through film, photography and performance, the artists in this exhibition explore the contours of belonging across different contexts - from the invention of nationalist social rituals to the homecoming of veterans, from the trope of the \"haunted\" house to that of the family portrait. By bringing together the work of an international group of artists approaching home as a volatile concept, this exhibition examines how fantasies of belonging involve complex psychic and affective responses to specific material and historical conditions informed by race, gender, sexuality and class.\"Itinerant Belongings\" grounds this inquiry by revisiting critical debates that bridged activism and art in the 1980s and 1990s. Responding to the presence of the homeless, the displaced, and the disenfranchised in American cities, two of the artists in the exhibition, William Pope.L and Krzysztof Wodiczko, produced projects in this critical moment that questioned the very notion of what it meant for a space to be \"public.\" This exhibition aims to reanimate this dialogue and extend it to a contemporary global landscape marked by mass displacement, armed conflict, and debates around borders and immigration.Work by Yael Bartana, Jamie Diamond, Andrew Moore, William Pope.L, Paul Salveson, Jessica Vaughn, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, and Krzysztof Wodiczko will be on display at Slought and the Addams Gallery at PennDesign, and viewers are encouraged to take an itinerant path from one exhibition site to another.\nMore information", "endtime": "", "event_id": "", "event_index": 488, "location": "Slought, 4017 Walnut Street, PhiladelphiaAddams Fine Arts Hall, 200 S. 36th Street, Philadelphia", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "", "summary": "", "title": "Itinerant Belongings", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/itinerant-belongings"},

How do their patterns provide protective camouflage in tropical rain forests? How is nanotechnology using the waterproofing properties of butterfly colors to fabricate energy-efficient materials for buildings? In this panel discussion, Penn researchers discuss how their scientific and technological work imitates nature.\nUsing holographic lithography, Shu Yang and her Penn research team recently developed a material that mimics the iridescent and water-resistant qualities of butterfly wings. Applying this innovation, they developed a superhydrophobic coating that can be sprayed onto any surface. The solution contains nanoscopic particles that add a nearly invisible layer of roughness to a surface. Among other things, this highly water resistant coating is now being used on solar panels to keep them drier, cleaner and more efficient.\nIn 2004, Shu Yang was named one of the World's Top 100 Innovators Under 35 by MIT Technology Review. In 2006, she received the prestigious Faculty Early Career Development Award from the National Science Foundation. And in 2011, she was selected by the National Academy of Engineering to present at the Japan-America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium. In addition to being widely published, Dr. Yang holds over 20 patents, issued or pending.\nDaniel Janzen is an evolutionary ecologist, biologist, and conservationist renowned for his pioneering work in tropical ecology and the conservation of endangered tropical ecosystems throughout the world. A former director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, he divides his time between Penn, where he teaches biology, and his research and field work in Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, he serves as technical advisor to Area de Conservacion Guanacaste (ACG), a 165,000 hectare government/private hybrid conservation area. He is also president of the Guanacaste Dry Forest Conservation Fund (GDFCF), the US-based NGO for ACG.\nHe and his wife, Winnie Hallwachs, are currently working to further the CBOL (Consortium for the Barcode of Life) and iBOL (International Barcode of Life) efforts to DNA barcode all species of the world for their identification and species discovery by anyone anywhere at any time.

Value with respect to color can mean the relative lightness or darkness of a hue, but can also mean aesthetic merit, political importance, moral acceptability, or material worth. The question of color's values is also fundamentally a question of sensory perception, constructed at the level of the individual synapse as well as the cultural collective. We want to consider the descriptive language of color\u2014how we evoke color with and/or through value-laden words or actions, how we assign qualities or quantities to different colors, how color is experienced through taste or touch as well as sight.Four distinguished scholars - Richard Doyle, Torkwase Dyson, Nicole Fleetwood, and Mohan Matthen - will explore the values of color from a variety of perspectives. How and why do we classify and assign values (moral, economic, social, epistemic) to particular colors, even 'people of color,' or material gradations, from light to dark? How does color function in a modern economy? What is its role in making subjectivity legible through its performance? How does color function as nonverbal communication that is affectively felt?

Now that the audience is assembled\u202f(Duke, 2018) is a prose poem that describes a fictional musical performance during which an unnamed musician improvises the construction of a series of invented instruments before an audience that is alternately contemplative, participatory, disputatious, and asleep. Both a work of literature and a study of music,\u202fNow that the audience is assembled\u202fexplores the categories of improvised music, solo performance, text scores, instrument building, aesthetic deskilling and reskilling, and the odd fate of the composer in experimental music. Grubbs\u2019s forthcoming The Voice in the Headphones (Duke, 2020) centers on the culture of the recording studio, presenting in intricate, prismatic detail one marathon day in a recording studio over the course of which an unnamed musician struggles to complete a film soundtrack. The Voice in the Headphones arrives at a moment in which the commercial recording studio shades into oblivion and is replaced by digital work environments; it draws upon Grubbs\u2019s own history of several decades as a recording artist, and its location could be described as every studio in which he has set foot. The experience of working in the recording studio is in large part the experience of the language that surrounds and infuses the world of the studio\u2014and that language is the material of this poem.\n\nAbout David Grubbs\n\nDavid Grubbs is Professor of Music at Brooklyn College and The Graduate Center, CUNY.\u00a0 At Brooklyn College he also teaches in the MFA programs in Performance and Interactive Media Arts (PIMA) and Creative Writing.\u00a0 He is the author of Now that the audience is assembled and Records Ruin the Landscape: John Cage, the Sixties, and Sound Recording\u00a0(both Duke University Press)and, with Anthony McCall, Simultaneous Soloists (Pioneer Works Press).\u00a0 In the spring of 2020, Duke University Press will publish The Voice in the Headphones, Grubbs\u2019s second experiment in music writing in the form of a book-length poem.\n\nGrubbs has released fourteen solo albums and appeared on more than 190 releases; his most recent solo recording is Creep Mission (Blue Chopsticks, 2017). In 2000, his The Spectrum Between\u00a0(Drag City) was named \u201cAlbum of the Year\u201d in the London Sunday Times.\u00a0 He is known for his ongoing cross-disciplinary collaborations with poet Susan Howe and visual artists Anthony McCall and Angela Bulloch, and his work has been presented at, among other venues, the Solomon R.

The event will take place in room 101 of the Music Building (Lerner Center, 201 South 34th Street) on Tuesday November 19th at 5:15. Reception will follow. Below please find an abstract. We look forward to seeing many of you at this talk!\n\nWhen Richard Wagner created a lowered orchestra pit at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in the 1870s he famously described the decision in terms of concealment; an attempt to hide the means of sound production. In view of the modifications made to numerous opera houses in the decades that followed to create similar orchestra pits, scholars have tended to assume that the Festspielhaus was both the stimulus and model for such spaces. If this tends to flatten out important variations in architectural design between theaters, it also narrates the introduction of orchestra pits from the perspective of audience members alone. While lowered orchestral platforms might have functioned as so-called \u201cmystical chasms\u201d from which sound floated upwards towards awed spectators, these also had a crucial role in the creation of enclosed, protected spaces for musicians.\n\nThe 1907 construction of the so-called \u201cgolfo mistico\u201d at the preeminent Teatro alla Scala in Milan, under the supervision of Arturo Toscanini, was to a considerable extent an experiment in the creation of a more professional atmosphere than performance at audience level allowed. However much the term golfo mistico betrays a Romantic conception of the space, it was not, I argue, coincidental that the pit was constructed in the same moment that trade unions for musicians were establishing themselves.

Alexander L. Fattal shows how the market has become one of the principal grounds on which counterinsurgency warfare is waged and postconflict futures are imagined in Colombia. This layered case study illuminates a larger phenomenon: the convergence of marketing and militarism in the twenty-first century. Taking a global view of information warfare,\u00a0Guerrilla Marketing\u00a0combines archival research and\u00a0extensive fieldwork not just with the Colombian Ministry of Defense and former rebel communities, but also with political exiles in Sweden and peace negotiators in Havana. Throughout, Fattal deftly intertwines insights into the modern surveillance state, peace and conflict studies, and humanitarian interventions, on one hand, with critical engagements with marketing, consumer culture, and late capitalism on the other. The result is a powerful analysis of the intersection of conflict and consumerism in a world where governance is increasingly structured by brand ideology and wars sold as humanitarian interventions.\n\u00a0\nFull of rich, unforgettable ethnographic stories,\u00a0Guerrilla Marketing\u00a0is a stunning and troubling analysis of the mediation of global conflict.\n\nNew Yorker\n\n\"A sobering book on how armies burnish their brands. . . a detailed, eye-opening investigation.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nReVista\n\n\"Guerrilla Marketing\u00a0is a fascinating book that illustrates how the government\u2019s turn to marketing blurred the boundaries between war and peace by penetrating deep into the emotional space of insurgents and their families. It is a well-written account that intersperses analytic chapters with the author\u2019s riveting interviews with FARC insurgents, which offer a view into how the rebels understand what has happened to themand sidesteps PAHD propaganda. The book should be read by anyone trying to understand contemporary Colombian society.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nJon Lee Anderson, author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life\n\n\u201cGuerrilla Marketing\u00a0is a fascinating examination of how commercial-style branding has been deployed by both rebels and the state in Colombia's civil war. Fattal deserves high praise for his extraordinary research, carried out over many years in the edgy and borderless terrain of the war's periphery. His insights are lucid and the stories he tells are haunting. This book is a must-read for scholars of modern conflict, journalists, and diplomats.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAbout the Speaker\nAlexander L. Fattal, Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication at the University of California, San Diego, is an anthropologist, filmmaker, and media activist who specializes in the mediation of the Colombian armed conflict.

This dystopian narrative has come to dominate political agendas across the globe. To save democracy \u2014 a number of voices argue \u2014 radical measures are needed. In this talk, Johan Farkas critically examines post-truth discourses, honing in on both the contemporary threats posed by disguised propaganda on social media and the risks of advancing undemocratic solutions to solve them.\nThe first part of the talk dives into the rise and proliferation of disguised propaganda on social media, drawing on empirical cases such as the Internet Research Agency in Russia and fake Muslim Facebook pages in Denmark. While disguised propaganda is not a new phenomenon in itself, the technological architecture of digital platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, enables new forms of manipulation, tactically exploiting interfaces, algorithmic proliferation, and content moderation policies. This poses novel challenges for democracy.\nDisguised propaganda in digital media have caused scholars, journalists, and politicians to talk about a post-truth crisis in dire need of fixing. Indeed, for many, truth must be restored at all costs, as democracy is founded on evidence-based decision-making. The second part of the talk critically engages with these post-truth discourses and the solutions they contain. Engaging with critical political philosophy, Farkas highlights how these \"democratic imaginaries\" neglect how democracy has never been about truth, evidence and rationality alone. It is equally about the voice of the democratic people. By neglecting this cornerstone of the democratic tradition, post-truth discourses reproduce and strengthen a risky vision of democracy \u2014 one in which consensus and rationality dominate over civic voices and popular dispute. By doing so, contemporary post-truth discourses \u2014 and the solutions they contain \u2014 might end up deepening existing democratic problems.\nThe talk is based on Farkas\u2019 new book, Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy: Mapping the Politics of Falsehood, written with Jannick Schou and published by Routledge.\nAbout the Speaker\nJohan Farkas is a Ph.D. Fellow in Media and Communication Studies at Malm\u00f6 University in Sweden. His research engages with the intersection of digital media platforms, disinformation, politics, journalism, and democracy. Farkas has published on these topics in international journals such as New Media & Society, Social Media + Society, and Critical Discourse Studies. In September 2019, his debut book, Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy: Mapping the Politics of Falsehood (with Jannick Schou) was published by Routledge. The book presents a detailed analysis of contemporary discourses of fake news and post-truth, offering both a trenchant critique and call for more inclusive forms of democracy. Farkas is currently Chair of the Young Scholars Network of the European Communication Research and Education Association (YECREA).

Cooper\u2019s exhibit features work by two collaborators \u2014 conceptual immersive audio work by Rutgers University doctoral student Katie Gressitt-Diaz and a traditional still photo series by photographer Kyle Cassidy \u2014 as well as an actual cryptocurrency mining operation, immersed in a liquid cooling bath, that will produce blockchain as viewers watch.\nJoin us for a gallery tour of the exhibit and a short lecture by Cooper on Tuesday, October 22 at 5pm. This event is part of Energy Week @ Penn and is sponsored by the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy.\nThe exhibit is open and on display through May 2020, and is part of Penn's Year of Data.\nAbout the Project\n\u201cAlchemical Infrastructures: Making Blockchain in Iceland\u201d explores not the mining of cryptocurrency, as it\u2019s conventionally thought of, but rather the complicated, difficult, political, and energy-intensive practice of making cryptocurrency in Iceland; a combinatory process of infrastructures, social systems, political institutions, and desires, all intentionally brought together in search of new monetary futures \u2014 or in other words, alchemy. Not unlike medieval alchemists, those building cryptocurrency and blockchain architectures must follow complicated recipes, conjuring the right assemblage of machine, human, and environment that will yield the greatest value \u2014 a value often dictated by and through energy costs and availability. In search of a sort of digital philosopher\u2019s stone, the blockchain alchemists flock to regions where the Earth sings with natural energy in order to mix and mingle their hardware \u2014 regions like Iceland. \u00a0\nThe exhibit examines the work of Iceland\u2019s blockchain alchemists by assembling and mixing different modes of qualitative research in an attempt to synthesize an understanding of what the practice of blockchain looks, feels, smells, and sounds like. The exhibit is loosely structured around an experimental documentary film, produced in 360-degree immersive video, that attempts to materialize, spatialize, and personalize the experience of blockchain in Iceland through the blending of multiple voices and stakeholders. Taking a multi-sited, network ethnographic approach, and through the lens of situational analysis, the film places blockchain in Iceland within a larger situation of action. The immersive juxtaposition and blending of environmental, industrial, and infrastructural spaces will educate viewers on the embedded complexities of blockchain as a system, illustrating how large technocratic imaginaries (like blockchain) are locally negotiated.\nWhile the film accentuates the visual and spatial experiences of blockchain in Iceland, the conceptual sound work by Katie Gressitt-Diaz brings the complex aural dimensions of this project into sharp relief. Sometimes we may feel it somewhere in our bones, or on the backs of our necks, but we often do not consciously consider sound\u2019s profound influence, and its communicative, affective power. Gressitt-Diaz\u2019s contributions to this exhibit will explore the variated and entangled sonic environments conjured forth in the alchemical making of cryptocurrency.\nAs both the film and the conceptual sound work endeavor to highlight friction, tension, entanglement, and collaboration, the photo series by Kyle Cassidy personalizes individual experiences of making blockchain in Iceland. Through Cassidy\u2019s photos, the turbulent ecology of cryptocurrency, energy, and earth is temporarily frozen in order to bring into focus the personal stakes, ambitions, and passions of those involved in Iceland\u2019s cryptocurrency ecology. In Cassidy\u2019s contribution, instead of the individual emerging from the situation, we see the situation brought forth through the individual.\nLastly, a Bitmain Antminer S7 cryptocurrency mining device is included as a material anchor, as well as the fourth active contributor to the exhibit. While the rest of the exhibit was produced digitally and can effectively be downloaded in its entirety, the cryptocurrency-producing Antminer is the only element of the show that is fundamentally not digitally native, and whose specific setup cannot be reproduced. As such, it is a tangible assemblage of potential value, actively combining and mixing with Penn\u2019s local infrastructure in search of Auroracoin, Iceland\u2019s unofficial national cryptocurrency. Throughout the year, Cooper will trace both how many coins the machine has produced, and how much energy it has used.\nThere are profound limits to how much the traditional academic article or monograph can communicate. Innovating the presentation of scholarship with tools like immersive video, conceptual audio, and photography can help illustrate socio-material affects and complexities that become obscured in traditional academic writing. Part of what this exhibit hopes to accomplish is to introduce new possibilities for conceptualizing and presenting our relationship to infrastructure, and to open up questions about how new ways of seeing can produce more just, equitable, and sustainable futures.", "endtime": "7:00pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 522, "location": "Annenberg School Forum", "owner": "Annenberg School of Communication", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "Gallery Tour \u2014 \"Alchemical Infrastructures: Making Blockchain in Iceland\"", "url": "https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/events/blockchain-gallery-tour"},

    {"date": "25 Oct 2019 - 12:00pm to 1:00pm", "date_dt": "25-10-2019", "description": "About the Talk\nWhy do people believe and share misinformation, including entirely fabricated news headlines (\u201cfake news\u201d) and biased or misleading coverage of actual events (\"hyper-partisan\" content)? The dominant narrative in the media and among academics is that we believe misinformation because we want to \u2014 that is, we engage in motivated reasoning, using our cognitive capacities to convince ourselves of the truth of statements that align with our political ideology rather than to undercover the truth. In a series of survey experiments using American participants, David Rand and colleagues challenged this account. They consistently found that subjects who perform better on the Cognitive Reflection Test (a measure of the tendency to engage in analytic thinking) are better able to identify false or biased headlines \u2014 even for headlines that align with individuals\u2019 political ideology (for details, see here and here). They also found that when examining actual Twitter behavior, more reflective individuals share information from higher quality news sources. These findings suggest that susceptibility to misinformation is driven more by mental laziness and lack of reasoning than it is by partisan bias hijacking the reasoning process. They then build on this observation to examine interventions to fight the spread of misinformation. In one, they show that laypeople are much less biased in their evaluation of the trustworthiness of news outlets than one might imagine, and give fake news and hyperpartisan outlets low trust ratings regardless of their political slant. Thus, using crowdsourced ratings of outlet quality to inform social media ranking algorithms is a promising approach (for details, see here). Second, the researchers demonstrate the power of making the concept of accuracy top-of-mind, thereby increasing the likelihood that people think about the accuracy of headlines before they decide whether to share them. Rand's results suggest that reasoning is not held hostage by partisan bias, but that instead participants do have the ability to tell fake or inaccurate from real \u2014 if they bother to pay attention. The findings also suggest simple, cost-effective behavioral interventions to fight the spread of misinformation.\nAbout the Speaker\nDavid G. Rand is the Erwin H. Schell Professor and an Associate Professor of Management Science and Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT Sloan, and the Director of the Human Cooperation Laboratory and the Applied Cooperation Team.\nBridging the fields of behavioral economics and psychology, Rand\u2019s research combines mathematical/computational models with human behavioral experiments and online/field studies to understand human behavior. His work uses a cognitive science perspective grounded in the tension between more intuitive versus deliberative modes of decision-making, and explores topics such as cooperation/prosociality, punishment/condemnation, perceived accuracy of false or misleading news stories, political preferences, and the dynamics of social media platform behavior. His work has been published in peer-reviewed journals such Nature, Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, the American Economic Review, Psychological Science, and Management Science.

If infrastructure conditions how information, people, and things circulate, then what might the practices of concealment tell us about the political stakes of circulation, and about the nature of our infrastructural surround? What kinds of visual forms emerge in global media events in which concealment is crucial part, sometimes even the condition of possibility for targetable people and equipment to stay on air. This colloquium examines these contradictions in the context of Lebanon, where infrastructural disrepair and breakdown parallel political impasses and fragmentation. It takes the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year as its case study. Based on fieldwork and visual analysis, El-Hibri examines how concealment structures phenomena ranging from live satellite news broadcasts, drone-cam footage, signal jamming and hacking, and online guerilla video from the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year. He shows how televisual liveness in this event \u2014 that new-again promise to see things faraway as they happen \u2014 demonstrates how the geopolitics of simultaneity has transformed in the contemporary moment.\nAbout the Speaker\nHatim El-Hibri is a\u00a0Faculty Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication and an\u00a0Assistant Professor of Film and Media at George Mason University. He earned his Ph.D in Media, Culture, and Communication from New York University, and previously was a member of the Media Studies Program at the American University of Beirut. His research and teaching interests are global and Arab media and communication, visual culture studies, media infrastructure, and urban studies. He is currently finalizing his first book titled\u00a0Visions of Beirut: The Urban Life of Media Infrastructure, which examines the history of how images and imaging processes \u2014 from colonial mapping to corporate film to live satellite broadcasts \u2014 have been mobilized in attempts to manage and contest the spaces and sociality of the city.

In his book,\u00a0The Palestinian Idea, Greg Burris argues that it is precisely through film and media that hope can occasionally emerge amidst hopelessness, emancipation amidst oppression, freedom amidst apartheid. The author employs the work of Edward W. Said, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, and Cedric J. Robinson in order to locate Palestinian utopia in the heart of the Zionist present. He analyzes the films of prominent directors Annemarie Jacir (Salt of This Sea,\u00a0When I Saw You) and Hany Abu-Assad (Paradise Now) to investigate the emergence and formation of Palestinian identity. Looking at Mais Darwazah\u2019s documentary\u00a0My Love Awaits Me by the Sea, Burris considers the counterhistories that make up the Palestinian experience\u2014stories and memories that have otherwise been obscured or denied. He also examines Palestinian (in)visibility in the global media landscape, and how issues of Black-Palestinian transnational solidarity are illustrated through social media, staged news spectacles, and hip hop music.\u00a0\n\"A deeply felt, brilliantly conceived, meticulously crafted book,\u00a0The Palestinian Idea\u00a0breaks new ground in how we understand vision, space, and identity.

Kraidy, Anthony Shadid Chair in Global Media, Politics and Culture at the University of Pennsylvania and author of\u00a0The Naked Blogger of Cairo: Creative Insurgency in the Arab World\u00a0\n\u00a0\"Greg Burris has written the book so many people have been waiting for\u2014and he's done it in sharp and readable prose. Situating Palestine in relation to various global revolutionary movements and animating Palestine's own revolutionary identity, Burris has managed the rare feat of producing scholarship that is both timeless and topical. By so thoroughly and imaginatively exploring the idea of Palestine, he illuminates exactly how real Palestine is.\" \u2014Steven Salaita, author of\u00a0Israel's Dead Soul\nAbout the Speaker\nGreg Burris is a film and cultural theorist whose work focuses on race, media, and emancipatory politics.

How is certain novel information about the world nevertheless made meaningful in their everyday lives? While a growing number of studies have focused on the role of multi-platform mobile technology in young people\u2019s daily experiences, few studies have aimed to reconceptualize news from this perspective, paying particular attention to the phenomenology of news perception in the digital age. Such a reconceptualization is all the more important since the basic dimensions of phenomenology \u2013 namely, time, space and cultural relevance \u2013 coincide with the basic dimensions of news as a cultural form. This talk will draw from ongoing fieldwork with college students in Kazan, Russia, focusing particularly on the challenges of conducting a \u201cnews reception\u201d study when what counts as \u201cnews\u201d is not separable from the rest of their coming-of-age experiences on and offline.\nNatalia Roudakova is a cultural anthropologist (Ph.D., Stanford University, 2007) working in the fields of political communication, journalism, and media studies, with an interest in moral philosophy and political and cultural theory.

Through a consideration of the television set\u2019s intertwining with devices ranging from VCRs to set-top boxes and optical-fiber cables, Chirumamilla exposes new veins of analysis through which we might understand both the inter-media history within which television in South India is embedded and the kinds of mediated futures that television\u2019s material transformations portend.\n\u00a0\nFollowing an overview of her larger project, which utilizes both ethnographic research and close textual analysis of newspapers, enthusiast magazines, and policy documents, Chirumamilla will turn her focus to the objects of the television set, the videotape, and the VCR. How does looking at these objects in concert with each other change our imagining of the historical trajectory of television in South India? She will argue that the television set\u2019s entanglement with videotapes and the VCR is illustrative of the contentious, close relationship between the commercial cinema industry and television\u2019s growing presence within the lives of Indian media consumers; an entanglement that has so far gone understudied and might offer us new ways to think about how we theorize the pasts and futures of media technologies.\n\u00a0\n\nAbout the Speaker\nPadma Chirumamilla\u00a0is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication. Her work examines how media infrastructures shape and are shaped by everyday cultural life and labor in postcolonial South India and the broader Global South. Her dissertation investigates how the television \u2014 both the physical object and the broader media entity \u2014 were integrated into the daily rhythms of viewers and media workers in small-town and rural regions in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, through venues like the repair shop and technologies likes the videotape and VCR. Through a combination of ethnographic and textually-based methods, Chirumamilla\u2019s research considers how the materiality of media shapes its absorption into the routines and rhythms of everyday life in the Global South. She is also interested in notions of technological futurity, and how the futuristic allure of digital technologies configures everyday encounters with media infrastructures in the Global South. Chirumamilla is a first-generation postsecondary scholar. She received her Ph.D. in Information Studies from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in the summer of 2019.

This vision entails large networks with dynamic connectivity, ad hoc formation and heterogeneous nodes. Central to be able to integrate all our lives to this massive virtual domain is security and privacy of the information that flows through it. Current wireless systems have security of information as an add-on to current design, and rely on application layer protocols, which have worked well for the scale and the resources of the systems to date. Going forward however, with massive scale formation of networks of asymmetric resources, these protocols involving key exchanges and shared randomness for security may prove to be less than practical.\nSecuring information at the foundation of system design can alleviate these issues by replacing or strengthening the present cryptographic solutions. This foundational design approach brings us to information theoretic security for the all- connected world. In this talk, we will provide an overview of this approach that relies on local randomness and produces information theoretic security guarantees, e.g, for confidentiality and authentication, utilizing the properties of the transmission medium. We will review the insights that have emerged when information security is included as a design primitive and provide the state of the art directions towards realizing the potential of this approach. We will also introduce models where this approach can be integrated with encryption for nodes with local memory storage.", "endtime": "4:00 PM", "event_id": "", "event_index": 699, "location": "Towne 337", "owner": "Electrical and Systems Engineering (ESE)", "speaker": "Aylin Yener\nDistinguished Professor of ECE, Penn State College of Engineering\nAylin Yener is a Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering and a Dean\u2019s Fellow at Penn State.

For example, the toughness of nacre, a structural biological material found in the shells of some mollusks, is orders of magnitude higher than that of its primary constituent\u2014the calcium based mineral aragonite. A number of structural biological materials that display toughness enhancement also possess a lamellar architecture consisting of alternating layers of ceramic and organic phases. It is believed that a structural biological material\u2019s intricate architecture\u2014the geometric arrangement of these phases\u2014is responsible for the observed property enhancements. Within the bio-mimetics community, there is currently great interest in reproducing these architectures in synthetic materials using micro-fabrication and 3D printing in order to achieve the property enhancements observed in structural biological materials.\nIn this talk I will present experimental and computational mechanics results that show that correctly identifying the connection between a structural biological material\u2019s architecture and any property enhancements can be a very delicate process. Specifically, I will present experiments that characterize the toughness properties of the skeletal elements of the marine sponge Euplectella aspergillum, called spicules. I will show that despite possessing a lamellar architecture that is very similar to that seen in nacre, the spicules do not display a significant toughness enhancement. Through mechanics modeling, I argue that the spicule\u2019s lamellar architecture is connected to their ability to bend more without failing, i.e., to their strength, rather than their toughness. These results serve as a reminder that any efforts aimed at reproducing a structural biological material\u2019s architecture and property enhancements in synthetic materials should be prefaced by a careful investigation of the structural biological material itself.\nReferences\n[1] Monn, Michael A., James C.

For these applications, visual-inertial odometry is a common way to localize the vehicles and observe the environment. However, unlike with wheeled mobile robots, quadrotor localization algorithms often do not use knowledge of the control inputs and the full vehicle dynamics as a process model for localization. Rather, they use kinematic models, with the IMU providing acceleration and angular velocity. One of the reasons for avoiding the use of dynamics is that, until recently quadrotor aerodynamic effects have not been considered in the literature and hence the dynamic models for quadrotors have been less accurate than those for wheeled mobile robots. The main aerodynamic terms that are significant are first-order effects that are linear in velocity and angular velocity. They are predominantly caused by aerodynamic interaction with the spinning propellers. This work investigates the models for such effects, as well as what can be gained if such aerodynamic effects are incorporated into the dynamic model and the full dynamics are used for state estimation. We develop novel IMU-based filters, the end results of which are used to estimate the wind velocity of the quadrotor or, indoors, when the ambient wind is zero, the velocity of the quadrotor. In addition, these filters estimate the many aerodynamic parameters in the model online. They may also be used to estimate sensor biases and inertial parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these filters through experiments. We also present nonlinear observability analyses that theoretically determine the observability properties of the systems.\nCommittee Members:\nVijay Kumar, Nemirovsky Family Dean of Engineering\nAni Hsieh, Research Associate Professor, MEAM\nKostas Daniliidis,\u00a0Ruth Yalom Stone Professor, CIS\nCamillo J.

Heusler compounds, for example, are of great interest due to their multifunctional properties including metallic, ferromagnetic, half metallic, semiconducting and potentially topological properties. Heterostructures of ferromagnetic materials with insulators and semiconductors have revolutionized spintronic devices.\nSemiconductors are an ideal choice for substrates for dissimilar materials epitaxial growth because of their wide range of lattice parameters, high quality, readily controlled electrical and optical properties and the availability of large area substrates at a reasonable cost. The control of strain and lattice matching, interfacial bonding and reactions is important for the growth and properties of dissimilar materials heterostructures.\nIn this presentation, results for the molecular beam epitaxial growth of metallic compound/III-V semiconductor heterostructures with designer properties will be discussed. High efficiency electrical spin injection and detection in magnetic Heusler/GaAs contacts, tuning of the spin polarization, as well as the ability to tune the electronic and magnetic properties of Heusler compounds through alloying will be presented. The focus of the presentation will be on understanding the growth and properties of dissimilar materials with emphasis on Heusler compound/III-V compound semiconductor heterostructures.

While these systems provide high-quality images, the improved functionality comes at the cost of increased size and weight. One route to reduce a system\u2019s complexity is via computational imaging, in which much of the aberration correction and functionality of the optical hardware is shifted to post-processing in the software realm. Alternatively, a designer could miniaturize the optics by replacing them with diffractive optical elements, which mimic the functionality of refractive systems in a more compact form factor. Metasurfaces are an extreme example of such diffractive elements, in which quasiperiodic arrays of resonant subwavelength optical antennas impart spatially-varying changes on a wavefront. While separately both computational imaging and metasurfaces are promising avenues toward simplifying optical systems, a synergistic combination of these fields can further enhance system performance and facilitate advanced capabilities.

Platelet aggregation is largely a physical process while coagulation is biochemical, consisting of a large network of reactions that culminate in the generation of the enzyme thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin, which polymerizes into fibers to form a stabilizing gel matrix in and around growing platelet aggregates. Thrombin also (re)binds directly to fibrin but this interaction, and its purpose, is not fully understood. Thrombin-fibrin binding is often described as two independent, single-step binding events, one high-affinity and one low-affinity, each through a different exosite on thrombin. However, kinetic schemes describing these single-step binding events with reported kinetic rate constants cannot explain experimentally-observed residency times of fibrin-bound thrombin. In this work, we study a bivalent, sequential-step binding scheme as an alternative to the high-affinity event, and in addition to the low-affinity one. We developed mathematical models for the single- and sequential-step schemes consisting of reaction-diffusion equations to compare to each other and to previously published experimental data. We then used Bayesian inference, in the form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo, to learn model parameter distributions from the experimental data. For the model to best fit the data, we needed an additional assumption that thrombin was irreversibly sequestered; we hypothesized that this could be due to thrombin becoming physically trapped within fibrin fibers as they formed. We also discuss how our model can be used to further probe scenarios dealing with thrombin allostery.", "endtime": "3:00 PM", "event_id": "", "event_index": 720, "location": "Towne 337", "owner": "Penn Institute for Computational Science (PICS)", "speaker": "Karin Leiderman\nAssociate Professor, Director of Graduate Studies, Department of Applied Math & Statistics, Colorado School of Mines\nKarin Leiderman is an Associate Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Colorado School of Mines.

But designing, deploying, and operating geographically-distributed systems consisting a hierarchy of sensing, storage, compute, and communication elements raises interesting new challenges across the system stack. In this talk, we will discuss our experiences designing new IoT systems to address several power and power grid monitoring problems. In particular, this talk will focus on three systems\u2014PowerBlade, Triumvi, and GridWatch\u2014and their motivation, design, and deployment. PowerBlade explores how to cost-effectively characterize, capture, and classify widespread plug-load energy usage\u2014representing the fastest growing and least understood segment of end-use energy consumption\u2014across hundreds of homes and offices representing tens of thousands of sensors.\nTriumvi explores how to make circuit level energy metering, useful for a variety of facilities trending, energy savings, and fault detection & diagnostics applications, more efficient and scalable. Finally, GridWatch explores how to scalably and cost-effectively detect and respond to the power outages that stymie residential and business activity in under-developed power grids using mobile and fixed sensors, data analytics, and reporting systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, finding that conventional approaches to outage detection systems vastly underreport customer experiences. These systems all share a similar architecture, require new sensor devices and edge-cloud data processing, and wrestle with power management and networking.

Structural differences between crystal polymorphs can affect desired properties, such as bioavailability of active pharmaceutical formulations, lethality of pesticides, or electrical conductivity of organic semiconductors. Crystallization conditions can influence polymorph selection, making an experimentally driven hunt for polymorphs difficult. Such efforts are further complicated when polymorphs initially obtained under a particular experimental protocol \u201cdisappear\u201d in favor of another polymorph in subsequent repetitions of the experiment. Consequently, theory and computational can potentially play a vital role in mapping the landscape of crystal polymorphism. Traditional crystal structure prediction methods face their own challenges, and therefore, new approaches are needed. In this talk, I will show, by leveraging concepts from mathematics and statistical mechanics in combination with techniques of molecular simulation, traditional methods, and machine learning, that a new paradigm in crystal structure prediction may be emerging.

    {"date": "November 26 2019", "date_dt": "26-11-2019", "description": "Recent developments in nanostructured materials have demonstrated myriad desirable properties ranging from optical and mechanical metamaterials to biomanipulative surfaces. To bring these properties from the lab to the commercial space will require innovative nanomanufacturing strategies focused on scalable and cost-effective techniques. My lab, the Hybrid Micro/Nanomanufacturing Laboratory, applies the manipulation of fundamental driving forces to this challenge through combinations of top-down and bottom-up techniques for new hybrid lithographic strategies. In this seminar, I will highlight one such strategy: self-limiting electrospray deposition (SLED) of thin film microcoatings. Electrospray deposition is a well-established technique for the creation of thin films from the spray of highly charged droplets loaded with the materials to be deposited. In SLED, specific manipulation of the electrostatic repulsion, hydrodynamic forces, and evaporation kinetics can be employed to conformally cover 3D architectures with microcoatings. The generated coatings are hierarchical, possessing either nanoshell or nanowire microstructure. Having demonstrated the mechanism of the self-limiting effect, we have developed the ability to employ materials that would be otherwise incompatible with self-limiting. In this way we have incorporated a wide variety of functional systems, including: (1) biocompatible, (2) plasmonic, (3) elastomerically-toughened composite, (4) anti-corrosive epoxy or sol gel, and (5) electrically conductive coatings. We have also characterized the geometric limits of features that can be coated through this approach, showing that the 3D capabilities increase with decreasing feature size to the micron-scale. This property, combined with the hierarchical structure of the coatings, shifts the burden of micro/nanoscale resolution from a costly or slow technique to a more scalable method, thereby removing barriers for integration into advanced manufacturing techniques such as roll-to-roll or additive manufacturing.", "endtime": "12:00 PM", "event_id": "", "event_index": 728, "location": "Wu and Chen Auditorium (Room 101), Levine Hall,  3330 Walnut Street", "owner": "Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM)", "speaker": "Jonathan Singer\nAssistant Professor, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Rutgers University\nJonathan Singer obtained his PhD (2013) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and MSc and BS (2008) from the University of Pennsylvania, all in Materials Science and Engineering.

We investigate the collection of solutions reached by the same network architecture, with different random initialization of weights and random mini-batches. These solutions are shown to be rather similar - more often than not, each train and test example is either classified correctly by all the networks, or by none at all.\u00a0 Surprisingly, all the network instances seem to share the same learning dynamics, whereby initially the same train and test examples are correctly recognized by the learned model, followed by other examples which are learned in roughly the same order. When extending the investigation to heterogeneous collections of neural network architectures, once again examples are seen to be learned in the same order irrespective of architecture, although the more powerful architecture may continue to learn and thus achieve higher accuracy. This pattern of results remains true even when the composition of classes in the test set is unrelated to the train set, for example, when using out of sample natural images or even artificial images. To show the robustness of these phenomena we provide an extensive summary of our empirical study, which includes hundreds of graphs describing tens of thousands of networks with varying NN architectures, hyper-parameters and domains. We also discuss cases where this pattern of similarity breaks down, which show that the reported similarity is not an artifact of optimization by gradient descent. Rather, the observed pattern of similarity is characteristic of learning complex problems with big networks. Finally, we show that this pattern of similarity seems to be strongly correlated with effective generalization.", "endtime": "10:30am", "event_id": "", "event_index": 825, "location": "3330 Walnut StreetWu & Chen Auditorium Levine 101", "owner": "General Robotics, Automation, Sensing & Perception laboratory (GRASP)", "speaker": " Daphna Weinshall, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, \"All Neural Networks are Created Equal\"", "starttime": "9:30am", "summary": "", "title": "GRASP Special Seminar: Daphna Weinshall, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, \"All Neural Networks are Created Equal\"", "url": "https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/events/daphna-weinshall"},

I will focus on a few topics to demonstrate how to leverage this idea of learning to learn, or meta-learning, to address a broad range of few-shot learning tasks: meta-learning in model space and task-oriented generative modeling.

To address this problem, we propose a paradigm shift. The current paradigm centers on generating one estimate at a time using a unique study design with unknown reliability and publishing (or not) one estimate at a time. The new paradigm advocates for high-throughput observational studies using consistent and standardized methods, allowing evaluation, calibration, and unbiased dissemination to generate a more reliable and complete evidence base. We demonstrate this new paradigm by comparing all hypertension treatments for a set of effectiveness and safety outcomes, producing 587,020 hazard ratios, each using methodology on par with state-of-the-art studies. We furthermore include control hypotheses to evaluate and calibrate our evidence generation process. Results agree with the limited number of randomized trials.

In simple models, causal parameters of interest are identified by variations of the functional known as the g-formula, and estimated using parametric and semi-parametric frameworks for statistical inference. Identification by the g-formula, and subsequent estimation methods in fully observed models have a clean interpretation in terms of the Markov factorization with respect to a directed acyclic graph (DAG). I show that this interpretation may be extended to arbitrary hidden variable causal models using a more involved nested Markov factorization with respect to a directed mixed graph. This view leads to a simple characterization of non-parametric identification for many parameters in causal inference, including causal effects, direct, indirect, and path-specific effects, responses to counterfactual policies, and many others. In addition, the nested Markov factorization avoids certain paradoxes associated with causal nulls, and leads to well-behaved model likelihoods that avoid making assumptions on unobserved variables, while capturing the structure these variables induce on the observed marginal distribution. This structure takes the form of all equality constraints induced by the hidden variable model, including conditional independences and \u201cVerma constraints.\u201d These restrictions may be used to make statistical inference more computationally tractable via probabilistic calculation procedures that generalize variable elimination algorithms in machine learning.", "endtime": "5:30 pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 833, "location": "F45 Huntsman Hall", "owner": "Wharton Statistics Seminars", "speaker": "Ilya Shpitser \u2013 Johns Hopkins University", "starttime": "4:30pm", "summary": "", "title": "Identification and Estimation of Causal Parameters via a Modified Factorization of a Graphical Model", "url": "https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/identification-and-estimation-of-causal-parameters-via-a-modified-factorization-of-a-graphical-model"},

In this talk, I will show that the same graphical criterions can be used in arbitrary causal diagrams when the goal is to minimize the asymptotic variance of non-parametric estimators of ATE that ignore the causal diagram assumptions. Furthermore, I will provide a graphical criterion to determine the optimal adjustment set among the minimal adjustment sets. In addition, I will provide another graphical criterion for determining when a non-parametric estimator of ATE is as efficient as an efficient estimator that exploits the causal diagram assumptions.

It has been argued that certain patterns of hidden bias may be directly attributable to the existence of heterogeneous treatment effects, stoking fear that sensitivity analyses assuming constant effects may be inadequate. We present a new method for\u00a0sensitivity\u00a0analysis\u00a0for the sample average treatment effect in paired observational studies while leaving the individual-level treatment effects unspecified.

A common alternative is a regression model that adjusts for the lagged dependent variable, which rests on the assumption of ignorability conditional on past outcomes. In this paper, we show a general nonparametric bracketing relationship between the difference-in-differences and lagged-dependent-variable regression estimates, under testable assumptions. Namely, for a true positive effect, if ignorability is correct, then mistakenly assuming parallel trends will overestimate the effect; in contrast, if the parallel trends assumption is correct, then mistakenly assuming ignorability will underestimate the effect. This provides a general strategy to construct bounds for the treatment effects. We provide three examples to illustrate the theoretical results.

While the framework is broadly applicable, we also instantiate it to obtain computationally and statistically efficient methods for truncated density estimation and truncated linear, logistic and probit regression in high dimensions. We also provide experiments to illustrate the practicality of our framework on synthetic and real data.

This practice, termed post-selection inference in the statistical literature, may negatively affect both point estimation and uncertainty quantification in A/B testing, and therefore hinder trustworthy decision making. To address this issue, we explore two seemingly unrelated paths, one based on supervised machine learning and the other on empirical Bayes, and propose post-selection inferential approaches that combine the strengths of both. Via large-scale simulated and empirical examples, we demonstrate that our proposed methodologies stand out among other existing methods in both reducing post-selection biases and improving confidence interval coverage rates, and discuss how they can be conveniently adjusted to real-life scenarios.", "endtime": "5:30 pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 839, "location": "F45 Huntsman Hall", "owner": "Wharton Statistics Seminars", "speaker": "Alex (Shaojie) Deng \u2013 Microsoft Analysis and Experimentation Team", "starttime": "4:30pm", "summary": "", "title": "Trustworthy Post-selection Inference in A/B Testing", "url": "https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/trustworthy-post-selection-inference-in-a-b-testing"},
    {"date": "Wednesday, October 30, 2019", "date_dt": "30-10-2019", "description": "Privacy-preserving data analysis has been put on a firm mathematical foundation since the introduction of differential privacy (DP) in 2006, with its deployment on iOS and Chrome lately. This privacy definition, however, has some well-known weaknesses: notably, it does not tightly handle composition. This weakness has inspired several recent relaxations of differential privacy based on Renyi divergences. We propose an alternative relaxation of differential privacy, which we term \u201cf-DP\u201d, which has a number of nice properties and avoids some of the difficulties associated with divergence based relaxations. First, it preserves the hypothesis testing interpretation of differential privacy, which makes its guarantees easily interpretable. It allows for lossless reasoning about composition and post-processing, and notably, a direct way to analyze privacy amplification by subsampling. We define a canonical single-parameter family of definitions within our class that is termed \u201cGaussian Differential Privacy\u201d, based on hypothesis testing of two shifted normal distributions. We prove that this family is focal to f-DP by introducing a central limit theorem, which shows that the privacy guarantees of any hypothesis-testing based definition of privacy (including differential privacy) converge to Gaussian differential privacy in the limit under composition. This central limit theorem also gives a tractable analysis tool. We demonstrate the use of the tools we develop by giving an improved analysis of the privacy guarantees of noisy stochastic gradient descent. This is joint work with Jinshuo Dong and Aaron Roth.", "endtime": "5:30 pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 840, "location": "F45 Huntsman Hall", "owner": "Wharton Statistics Seminars", "speaker": "Weijie Su \u2013 University of Pennsylvania", "starttime": "4:30pm", "summary": "", "title": "Gaussian Differential Privacy", "url": "https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/gaussian-differential-privacy"},
