How do known aspects of neural circuit dynamics and synaptic plasticity conspire to construct such internal maps? We demonstrate analytically how a neural attractor model that combines path integration of self-motion with Hebbian plasticity in synaptic weights from landmark cells can self-organize a consistent internal map of space as the animal explores an environment. Intriguingly, the emergence of this map can be understood as an elastic relaxation process between landmark cells mediated by the attractor network. Moreover, we verify several experimentally testable predictions of our model, including: (1) systematic deformations grid cells in irregular environments, (2) path-dependent shifts in grid cells towards the most recently encountered landmark, (3) a dynamical phase transition in which grid cells can break free of landmarks in altered virtual reality environments and (4) the creation of topological defects in grid cells. Taken together, our results conceptually link known biophysical aspects of neurons and synapses to an emergent solution of a fundamental computational problem in navigation, while providing a unified account of disparate experimental observations.This talk is part of the Year of Brain Science Technology talk series.

In this presentation, I argue that much of what we think we \u201cknow\u201d about racial profiling is wrong. Popular definitions of the term \u201cracial profiling\u201d are much too narrow or too vague, and, in this way, they are wrong. I contend prevailing thought on the causes of racial profiling as residing within individuals is deeply flawed and leads to interventions that will be ineffective such as implicit bias training. I demonstrate that racial profiling is not primarily a problem of biased cognitions; instead, racial profiling is caused by remediable structural factors that are beyond the control of individual officers patrolling American streets. These structural factors motivate police officers to take racially biased actions and facilitate racial profiling by providing legally defensible shields to conceal biased actions. The recognition of the true causes of racial profiling combined with technological innovations in policing lead to real-world solutions that could end racial profiling.\u00a0", "endtime": "01:00 PM", "event_index": 73, "location": "395 McNeil Building\u00a0\n3718 Locust Walk\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Dapartment of Criminology", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "title": "Criminology Colloquium Series: Ojmarrh Mitchell", "url": "https://crim.sas.upenn.edu/events/criminology-colloquium-series-ojmarrh-mitchell"},

Such studies were perhaps the impetuses in important policies such as \u201cBan the Box\u201d, which was intended to reduce the inequalities faced by ex-offenders during the job search process. While insightful, much of the work in this area has predominantly focused on the behavior of employers in the low wage labor market\u2014that is, they investigate how (un)likely employers are to hire/call back applicants with criminal records. We argue that such a heavy focus on this \u2018demand side\u2019 of the labor market hinders our theoretical understanding of offender decision making processes and prevents a more complete understanding of the impact of criminal justice contact on employment. We therefore turn our attention to the \u2018supply side\u2019 and examine the relationship between employment expectations, criminal justice contact, and worker discouragement.\u00a0 We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to answer three research questions: 1) Is criminal justice contact related to employment expectations? 2) Are these expectations related to worker discouragement? 3) If so, does criminal justice contact moderate this relationship? By studying the supply side, we hope our results can add to a growing body of research on criminal justice contact and labor markets.", "endtime": "01:00 PM", "event_index": 74, "location": "395 McNeil Building, 3718 Locust Walk\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Dapartment of Criminology", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "title": "Criminology Colloquium Series: Holly Nguyen", "url": "https://crim.sas.upenn.edu/events/criminology-colloquium-series-holly-nguyen"},

During booms, employment in agriculture declines while labor productivity increases in agriculture more than in other sectors. We construct a unified theory of business cycles and structural change consistent with the stylized facts. The focal point of the theory is the simultaneous decline and modernization of agriculture.

Because many everyday choices involve risk, these attitudes enter virtually every realm of individual decision-making. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for deducing preferences over risky social choices (which have consequences both for the Decision Maker and for others) from risky personal choices (which have consequences only for the Decision Maker) and riskless social choices, and we offer an experimental test of the theory.

Although objects of interest may mostly depend on a few prices, many prices should be included to control for omitted variables bias.This paper uses Lasso to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in estimating the average expenditure share from cross-section data. We estimate bounds on consumer surplus (BCS) using a novel double/debiased Lasso method. These bounds allow for general, multidimensional, nonseparable heterogeneity and solve the \"zeros problem\" of demand by including zeros in the estimation.We also use panel data to allow for prices paid to be correlated with preferences. We average ridge regression individual slope estimators and bias correct for the ridge regularization.We find that panel estimates of price elasticities are much smaller than cross section elasticities in the scanner data we consider. Thus, it is very important to allow correlation of prices and preferences to correctly estimate elasticities. We find less sensitivity of consumer surplus bounds to this correlation.", "endtime": "6:00pm", "event_index": 108, "location": "PCPSE Room 200 \n          United States", "owner": "Department of Economics", "speaker": "Whitney Newey, MIT", "starttime": "4:30pm", "title": "Demand Analysis with Many Prices", "url": "https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/events/demand-analysis-many-prices"},

We call such acquisitions \"killer acquisitions.\" We develop a parsimonious model illustrating this phenomenon. Using pharmaceutical industry data, we show that acquired drug projects are less likely to be developed when they overlap with the acquirer's existing product portfolio, especially when the acquirer's market power is large due to weak competition or distant patent expiration. Conservative estimates indicate about 6% of acquisitions in our sample are killer acquisitions.

The FLM generalizes Luce's model and naturally captures bounded rationality models while behaviorally distinguishing between what is focal and the magnitude of the bias due to focality. We show how to identify utilities, focal sets, and bias terms from choice frequencies and behaviorally found the FLM with two weakenings of independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA) which account for the decision maker's revealed focus. We introduce a new condition on focal sets, Conditionally Decreasing, which captures an increasing difficulty of focusing on multiple alternative and encompasses several models of limited consideration. We apply our model to experimental data, illustrate the importance of accounting for focus in demand estimation, and propose a simple method to identify focal sets.", "endtime": "5:30pm", "event_index": 111, "location": "PCPSE Room 101 \n          United States", "owner": "Department of Economics", "speaker": "Matthew Kovach, Virginia Tech", "starttime": "4:00pm", "title": "The Focal Luce Model", "url": "https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/events/focal-luce-model"},

  {"date": "November 21, 2019 - 4:30pm", "date_dt": "21-11-2019", "description": "This paper investigates two strategies that female figures in ancient Greek texts use to express anger and retaliate against those who have personally injured them: deprivation and magic. Both of these strategies base their efficacy in enacting harm to bodies in response to acute emotional distress. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, for example, the goddess Demeter refuses to let the grain grow in protest for her daughter\u2019s kidnapping, which in turn creates a crisis of hunger in both mortal and immortal societies. In Euripides\u2019 Hippolytus, Phaedra avenges unrequited love for her stepson through an escalation of attacks on her own body, which ultimately leads to his demise. Phaedra responds to the shame she feels by committing suicide, and before that to the depression brought forth by unrequited love through starvation. In multiple versions of her myth, Medea\u2019s anger at her treatment by the men around her causes her to lash out, whether against Jason in Euripides\u2019 Medea through the murder of her children or against her father in Apollonius Rhodius\u2019 Argonautica through the dismemberment of her brother. In a real-world example from the Greek Magical Papyri, a woman named Artemisie commissions a lead curse tablet against the father of her daughter, appealing to the supernatural to punish him for not giving their child a proper burial (PGM XL). In these and other cases, women refuse to accept the decisions and roles meted out by the men who have legal authority over them. Although they initially act within traditional boundaries, they eventually find that they must resort to employing incursions against vulnerable bodies \u2013 their own and others \u2013 often through the manipulation of supernatural forces. Whether through direct or indirect attack, women in our ancient Greek sources use their anger to fuel action, to assert themselves as individuals, and to reset the boundaries that constrain them.", "endtime": "6:00pm", "event_index": 167, "location": "402 Cohen Hall", "owner": "Department of Classical Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "4:30pm", "title": "COLLOQUIUM: Suzanne Lye, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, \"To Starve and To Curse: A Woman\u2019s Anger in Ancient Greek Literature and Magic\"", "url": "https://www.classics.upenn.edu/events/colloquium-suzanne-lye-university-north-carolina-chapel-hill-starve-and-curse-woman%E2%80%99s-anger"},

A long-standing problem with such regression analyses is the lack of effective diagnostic tools for validating model assumptions. The difficulty arises from the fact that an ordinal variable has discrete values that are labeled with, but not, numerical values. The values merely represent ordered categories. In this paper, we propose a surrogate approach to defining residuals for an ordinal outcome Y. The idea is to define a continuous variable S as a \u201csurrogate\u201d of Y and then obtain residuals based on S. For the general class of cumulative link regression models, we study the residual\u2019s theoretical and graphical properties. We show that the residual has null properties similar to those of the common residuals for continuous outcomes. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the residual has power to detect misspecification with respect to 1) mean structures; 2) link functions; 3) heteroscedasticity; 4) proportionality; and 5) mixed populations. The proposed residual also enables us to develop numeric measures for goodness-of-fit using classical distance notions. Our results suggest that compared to a previously defined residual, our residual can reveal deeper insights into model diagnostics. We stress that this work focuses on residual analysis, rather than hypothesis testing. The latter has limited utility as it only provides a single p-value, whereas our residual can reveal what components of the model are mis specified and advise how to make improvements.\n\n\n  This is a joint work with Dungang Liu, University of Cincinnati Lindner College of Business.", "endtime": " 4:30pm", "event_index": 256, "location": "701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "3:30pm ", "title": "Biostatistics Seminar Series - Heping Zhang, PhD", "url": "http://events.med.upenn.edu/cceb/#!view/event/event_id/710452"},

Her research focuses on the impact of health behaviors and modifiable risk factors in the development and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its complications, as well as addressing implementation gaps of evidence-based care in CKD. She has contributed to the growing evidence base that seeks to prioritize behavior recommendations for management of CKD as well as assessing barriers to healthy behavior engagement. She has conducted studies that have identified high levels of substandard health behavior engagement among adults with CKD and phenotypes of behavior engagement that associate with clinical outcomes in this population. Her present work includes assessing for real-time barriers to self-management health behaviors by interviewing patients with CKD and developing a patient-centered behavioral intervention that leverages mobile health technology to increase engagement in healthy behaviors. She will conduct its feasibility in a clinical trial. Dr. Schrauben is moving into the area of implementation science in order to address implementation gaps in evidence-based CKD care. Her future work aims to guide the development of innovative strategies to improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes in CKD.\n\n\nDr. Schrauben received her undergraduate degree in Human Biology with a specialization in Health Promotion from Michigan State University, and her medical degree from the College of Human Medicine at Michigan State University.

The workshop will convene at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for the Study of Contemporary China (CSCC) on Saturday, October 26, 2019. CHAIR brings young IR scholars together to share their latest research related to China, build a professional network, and strengthen the academic community that focuses on China and IR topics. CHAIR is also the ideal venue for participants to present revised versions of papers from APSA\u2019s summer 2019 meeting or rough drafts of papers for ISA\u2019s spring 2020 convention. CSCC will reimburse participants up to $500 for accommodation and travel expenses. The bulk of our applications tends to come from the United States and Canada, but we are open to applicants from around the world (those traveling from beyond the US East Coast may be eligible for additional funding).\nWe are looking for approximately ten participants to present works that are part of their dissertations or that they intend to publish. Paper topics span the entire range of the IR sub-field, and abstracts will be chosen based on their level of development, fit with other submissions as part of a cohesive session, and representation of diverse perspectives, methodologies, and institutions. The day-long workshop will consist of four thematically-organized sessions, each comprised of 2-3 presenters and a discussant. Each presenter need only offer a\u00a0brief\u00a0overview of the paper (~5 minutes), to be followed by the discussant\u2019s short, detailed comments on all the papers (~15 minutes). The majority of each session will be devoted to discussion open to all the participants.\u00a0We expect all participants to have read the papers before the workshop, so that workshop discussions on the day can be as fruitful and productive as possible.\nCHAIR offers an opportunity to build a community of young IR scholars who study China, and there will be ample time for socializing throughout the day. In addition to inter-session breaks, a catered lunch will be provided and, at the workshop\u2019s conclusion, we will be pleased to host dinner at a local restaurant for further conversation in a more casual setting. CHAIR thus represents an excellent opportunity for academic enrichment and professional networking. To see past workshop participants and papers, please visit our\u00a0Facebook page.

Wary of these dangers, China\u2019s national leaders have tried to forestall top-heavy urbanization. However, urban and regional development policies at the subnational level have not always followed suit.\u00a0China\u2019s Urban Champions\u00a0explores the development paths of different provinces and asks why policymakers in many cases favor big cities in a way that reinforces spatial inequalities rather than reducing\u00a0them.\nKyle Jaros combines in-depth case studies of Hunan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Jiangsu provinces with quantitative analysis to shed light on the political drivers of uneven development. Drawing on numerous Chinese-language written sources, including government documents and media reports, as well as a wealth of field interviews with officials, policy experts, urban planners, academics, and businesspeople, Jaros shows how provincial development strategies are shaped by both the horizontal relations of competition among different provinces and the vertical relations among different tiers of government. Metropolitan-oriented development strategies advance when lagging economic performance leads provincial leaders to fixate on boosting regional competitiveness, and when provincial governments have the political strength to impose their policy priorities over the objections of other\u00a0actors.\nRethinking the politics of spatial policy in an era of booming growth,\u00a0China\u2019s Urban Champions\u00a0highlights the key role of provincial units in determining the nation\u2019s metropolitan and regional development\u00a0trajectory.\nKyle A.

Rich served for six years as the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He was appointed by President Barack Obama and confirmed by a bipartisan vote of the Senate. Most recently, Rich was a candidate for Governor of Ohio in 2018.\nDuring his tenure, the Consumer Bureau brought enforcement actions that returned over $12 billion to 30 million Americans. They created a consumer response system that gave people a voice; more than 1.3 million people had issues resolved by this means. And they adopted new rules to safeguard the multi-trillion-dollar mortgage market and prevent the kind of problems that led to the financial crisis of 2008 and the deep recession that followed.\nBefore joining the Consumer Bureau, Rich served as Ohio\u2019s Attorney General, where he and his team recovered over $2 billion for Ohio\u2019s retirees, investors, and business owners and took major steps to protect consumers from fraudulent foreclosures and financial predators. He also served as Ohio Treasurer, where he led the State\u2019s banking, investment, debt, and financing activities. Rich previously taught at Ohio State\u2019s law school and served as a State Representative and as Ohio\u2019s first Solicitor General.

The 3-D printing process builds a three-dimensional object from a computer-aided design model by adding material, such as liquid resin or powder grains being fused together, layer by layer. This process is also known as additive manufacturing. In the early 1990s, 3-D printing techniques were considered suitable only for the production of functional or aesthetic prototypes. Fast-forward 30 years, and the speed, precision, repeatability, and material range have increased to the point that 3-D printing processes are now used in commercial industrial production. One of the key advantages of 3-D printing is the ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries directly without need for a mold. Thus the technology also lends itself to mass customization, where items, such as running shoes, can be customized to an individual\u2019s needs. Turner will discuss advances in the basic understanding of mechanical design of materials and components made via additive manufacturing. Liu will detail some of the state-of-the-art developments in additive manufacturing for the industrial scale; he has spent the last few years developing polymeric materials specifically for this application.

Italian merchants in 17th century Amsterdam\" \n(see abstract below)\nIt'll take place in Cherpack at 5:15 on Thursday Oct. 24. We hope to see many of you at this event.\n***\nABSTRACT\nEver since Genoese galleys had made their appearance at Bruges in the last quarter of the 13th century, communities of Italian long distance traders had been residing in the Low Countries. In the 16th century, most of them lived in Antwerp, then the commercial metropolis of the Low Countries. However, by the end of that century political and religious turmoil and climatological and demographic transformations had radically altered the trade patterns between the two regions. In 1585, Dutch rebels closed off Antwerp\u2019s access to the sea. Moreover, large parts of Italy became dependent upon the import of grains from the North. Therefore, by the 1590s many Italian merchants had left Antwerp. Subsequently, some of them, mostly Protestant Lucchese bankers, established themselves in Amsterdam.\nIn the final phases of the Thirty Years war a second wave of Italian migrants joined them. These new migrants mostly stemmed from humbler backgrounds. Moreover, they originated from provincial towns and not from commercial hubs such as Venice or Florence. Silvio Tensini, from Crema in Lombardy and his son in law Francesco Feroni, from Empoli in Tuscany were examples in point. In this lecture, I shall highlight the career of the latter.\nOriginally, Feroni concentrated on the import of Baltic grains to Italy, for which he established a network that stretched from Archangel in Russia, over Hamburg and Amsterdam to ports along the Tyrrhenian coast, such as Genoa, Livorno or Civitavecchia. Subsequently, he diversified his business and he started to import Spanish wools to the Netherlands and to export Dutch books, scientific instruments and works of art to Italy. Finally, he engaged in the triangular trade across the Atlantic in slaves and sugar. Moreover, Feroni acted as an information broker and an officious representative of the Medici Grand Dukes in the Dutch Republic. Within two decades, he became one of Amsterdam\u2019s wealthiest merchants.\nIn contrast to the first wave of immigrants, Feroni and his peers remained staunch Catholics. Thanks to his Roman contacts, he became an influential figure in the local Catholic minority community and he advocated its interests with the Protestant urban magistrate. Although it seems that Feroni never learnt Dutch, he thus was relatively well integrated.\nFrom the 1660s onward, a third wave of Italian migration followed suit. In response to the aggressive policies of King Louis XIV, Florentine bankers and merchants gradually withdrew from Paris and settled in Amsterdam. They stimulated a new increase both in the maritime and in the overland trade between the Dutch Republic and various Italian states. However, from the 1670s until the early 18th century, the Dutch economy entered a phase of stagnation and by then Amsterdam attracted less foreign merchants. In the 18th century, most Italian immigrants to the Dutch Republic would be artisans instead of merchants.\nFrancesco Feroni\u2019s extra-ordinary career testifies from the dynamic character of the Italian trade during an age in which the economy of the peninsula stagnated. His activities fit into a broader pattern and therefore it is worthwhile to analyze them.\n\u00a0\n", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_index": 365, "location": "Cherpack Seminar Room - 543 Williams Hall", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "title": "Hans Cools (Brueghel Visiting Professor at Penn) on Italians in Early Modern Amsterdam (Cherpack)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2019/10/hans-cools-brueghel-visiting-professor-penn-italians-early-modern-amsterdam-cherpack"},

We look forward to seeing many of you at this talk!\n\u00a0\n*****\nWhen Richard Wagner created a lowered orchestra pit at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in the 1870s he famously described the decision in terms of concealment; an attempt to hide the means of sound production. In view of the modifications made to numerous opera houses in the decades that followed to create similar orchestra pits, scholars have tended to assume that the Festspielhaus was both the stimulus and model for such spaces. If this tends to flatten out important variations in architectural design between theaters, it also narrates the introduction of orchestra pits from the perspective of audience members alone. While lowered orchestral platforms might have functioned as so-called \u201cmystical chasms\u201d from which sound floated upwards towards awed spectators, these also had a crucial role in the creation of enclosed, protected spaces for musicians.\nThe 1907 construction of the so-called \u201cgolfo mistico\u201d at the preeminent Teatro alla Scala in Milan, under the supervision of Arturo Toscanini, was to a considerable extent an experiment in the creation of a more professional atmosphere than performance at audience level allowed. However much the term golfo mistico betrays a Romantic conception of the space, it was not, I argue, coincidental that the pit was constructed in the same moment that trade unions for musicians were establishing themselves. Meanwhile, musicians were also becoming familiar with other sorts of enclosures calibrated to control acoustics and eliminate distractions, in the form of the earliest sound studios. Placing La Scala\u2019s golfo mistico in the context of these dual developments in the Italian music industry at the time, I reveal the extent of the orchestra pit\u2019s entanglements in a musical landscape which increasingly placed musicians at one remove from their audiences; in tandem, I offer a new framework in which to make sense of the new (and enduring) fashion for this architectural innovation.", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_index": 367, "location": "Music Building, Lerner Center 101", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "Prof. Laura Protano-Biggs", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "title": "Laura Protano-Biggs on the Teatro alla Scala in Milan (Music Building)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2019/11/laura-protano-biggs-teatro-alla-scala-milan-music-building"},

He saw alchemy as a means to restore the Church following the imminent arrival and subsequent defeat of the Antichrist.

Law enforcement representatives instead push family members to settle problems on their own. Given such a context, this presentation explores how law and legal norms impact relationships between parents and children after divorce. All dynamics of post-divorce kinship begin from the legal fact that there is no joint custody in Japan. Throughout the postwar, rates of custody being granted to mothers have steadily increased, and currently stand at eighty percent. Moreover sole legal custody is coupled with a cultural belief that a \u201cclean break\u201d can benefit children because it is psychologically less damaging to have no contact with one parent than shuttle between two households. However there is a growing movement, organized mostly by non-custodial fathers, to \u201creform\u201d Japanese family law and popularize a joint custody option. This presentation focuses on both people who experienced a \u201cclean break\u201d divorce and those who are increasingly calling that disconnection into question. I argue that although there are no requirements for shared custody, a substantial minority of families sustain de facto joint custody. Demonstrating contested, shifting ideals of familial bonds, these attempts to share custody highlight desires to redress the disconnection divorce produces and to create connected families, even when they bring legal risks.\nAllison Alexy\u00a0is an assistant professor in the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures and Department of Women\u2019s Studies at the University of Michigan.

I will explore the sex/gender dynamics informing the design and embodiment of artificial intelligence (AI) and robots, especially humanoids. In Japan, PM Abe is a leading promoter of the robotization of the labor force, including child- and elder-care, and has argued that robots will save the Japanese economy and liberate (married) women.

The first expansion of humans \u2013 Homo erectus- began 2.4 \u2013 1.8 million ago. The second expansion, this time of Homo sapiens sapiens, reached China between 85,000 and 80,000 BP. The expansion of speakers of Austronesian languages, returned to Africa, reaching Madagascar in the early centuries of the present era. The diffusion of domesticated plants, like bananas, from New Guinea to South Asia and Africa and dated to the mid-fourth millennium in Uganda and mid-first millennium BCE in southern Cameroon, provide additional evidence of interactions between Africa and Asia. Africa and Asia have long been in regular contact, through land and seas. \nHis paper will explore different facets of these Africa-Asia connections using glimpses gleaned from our ongoing archaeological research on the Island of Manda in Kenya, where we have unearthed excellent archaeological remains of the existence of trade between Africa and China. As to whether this interaction was direct, the jury is still out. Archaeologists presently accept the notion that the period between 700 and 1500 CE was the Era of Asian dominance.\u00a0 This was a time when the economic, social, and political order was vested in Buddhist and Islamist states, kingdoms, and empires. Interactions were dominated by regions that were connected by the Silk Road commercial complex.\nEastern and Southeastern Africa, which for millennia had pursued its own peculiar ways of making a living, was \u2018recruited\u2019 into this global network and became a regular partner. Its highly desirable resources included ambergris, aromatic products, iron bloom, gold, ivory, leopard skins, and rhinoceros\u2019 horns among others.\u00a0 Our paper address eastern Africa\u2019s participation in these transformational global networks using archaeological data. We specifically focus on two sets of data from the Manda site: Chinese porcelain and Identities of the participants in this trade, through a discussion on the human remains recovered at Manda.\n", "endtime": "05:30 PM", "event_index": 398, "location": "", "owner": "Center for East Asian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "4:30pm", "title": "CEAS Humanities Series \"Ancient trade networks between China and Africa\"", "url": "https://ceas.sas.upenn.edu/events/ceas-humanities-series-ancient-trade-networks-between-china-and-africa"},

Ch\u2019\u014fn drew on a wide network of relationships both inside and outside the court to help establish the first modern institution of Korean Buddhism, build the first modern temple in central Seoul, and open the first modern Buddhist clinic in Korea. This article seeks to restore Ch\u2019\u014fn\u2019s centrality as a Buddhist modernizer, thereby ultimately bringing balance to a largely monastic-centered and nationalist history and lengthening the lineage of lay female leadership in the transformation of Korean Buddhism in the beginning of the twentieth century.\n", "endtime": "01:00 PM", "event_index": 401, "location": "", "owner": "Center for East Asian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00pm", "title": "Korean Studies Colloquium \"Restoring Buddhism to Seoul: Court Lady Ch\u2019\u014fn\u2019s Influence in Modernizing Korean Buddhism\"", "url": "https://ceas.sas.upenn.edu/events/korean-studies-colloquium-restoring-buddhism-seoul-court-lady-ch%E2%80%99%C5%8Fn%E2%80%99s-influence-modernizing"},

They grew especially alarmed at the growing power the government was giving to psychiatrists to oversee the psychological wellbeing of Americans. Using the state\u2019s police powers, they feared, liberals would soon declare anti-communists and other conservatives mentally ill and banish them to mental institutions. Two events in the 1950s brought these anxieties to a fever pitch: the involuntary confinement of Vermont anti-communist activist Lucille Miller to a federal psychiatric hospital and federal legislation to fund the construction of a mental hospital in the Alaska territory.\n  In their campaigns to free Miller and stop the construction of what they believed would be an Alaskan gulag, these activists turned to the law. They argued that the Constitution safeguarded a vision of liberty as the absence of unwanted government intrusions into an individual\u2019s life. While these ultraconservative activists were dismissed as crackpots, many of their critics also felt a sense of diminished autonomy in the postwar world.

Since the early nineteenth century, Americans opposed the immigration of poor foreign workers who would degrade the dignity of labor and lower American wage standards. The opposition to immigrant labor became especially strong in the case of contract workers. In 1885, American workers\u2019 antipathy to \u201calien contract labor\u201d resulted in the passage of the federal Foran Act to ban the landing of foreign contract workers and deport those already in the United States back to their countries of origin. This project examines how hostility toward contract labor migration influenced American immigration law and how the alien contract labor law in turn affected immigrant workers.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  The paper traces the intellectual and legal genealogy of alien contract labor law by surveying the antebellum roots of opposition to imported labor in the United States. While labor radicalism in the late nineteenth century played a crucial role in the introduction of the Foran Act, the federal law was built upon earlier discourses on servile labor and the economic impact on Americans of immigration of certain kinds. In particular, the paper identifies the following four issues in antebellum America as the ideological and legal origins of the alien contract labor law: 1) Free Soilism, 2) \u201cpauper labor\u201d discourse, 3) assisted emigration, and 4) coolieism. The analysis in this paper is not intended to provide new evidence or revise historiography on these topics. Instead, the paper aims to demonstrate how the antebellum debates over the four issues collectively, if not exclusively, laid the foundations for the federal alien contract labor law, placing it in the broader framework of immigration politics beyond the labor conflict in the late nineteenth century.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Hidetaka Hirota is a non-tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Institute for Advanced Study at Waseda University in Japan.

For a while the family was allowed to remain in its own home, but was later relocated to a labor camp, where many of the Nazi guards could be bribed. After being paid off, the guards allowed 5-year-old Roald, his mother, two aunts, and an uncle to escape in early 1943. A Ukrainian couple hid them in the attic and storeroom of a nearby schoolhouse where the husband taught. Hoffmann's father remained behind in the camp, where he was tortured and killed by the Nazis in June 1943 for his involvement in a plot to arm camp prisoners.After the war ended, Hoffmann and his mother relocated to New York, where he later won a Westinghouse science scholarship to Columbia University, earning his BA there. He took his doctorate in chemistry from Harvard and in 1965 began teaching chemistry at Cornell, where he is now Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters Emeritus. Since 2002, Hoffmann has hosted a monthly cabaret called \"Entertaining Science\" at Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9 in Greenwich Village.In 1963 Hoffmann introduced the extended H\u00fcckel method, a molecular orbital theory that allows calculation of the electronic structure of molecules. In 1965, in collaboration with Nobel laureate Robert Burns Woodward, he introduced the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a method for exploring the electronic structure of transition states and intermediates in organic reactions. Hoffmann and Japanese chemist Kenichi Fukui shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1981 for their theories, developed independently, concerning the course of chemical reactions (Woodward had died two years earlier and thus was ineligible).Hoffmann is also a published poet, playwright, and essayist. His poems appear in several collections: The Metamict State (1987), Gaps and Verges (1990), Memory Effects (1999), and Soliton (2002). In addition, he is a philosopher of science who has made significant contributions to our conceptual, historical, and normative understanding of chemistry. Many of his philosophical essays have been collected in Roald Hoffman on the Philosophy, Art, and Science of Chemistry by Jeffrey Kovac and Michael Weisberg, eds. (2012).", "endtime": "6:30pm", "event_index": 467, "location": "Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:00pm", "title": "The Allure of Indigo", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/allure-indigo"},

Through film, photography and performance, the artists in this exhibition explore the contours of belonging across different contexts - from the invention of nationalist social rituals to the homecoming of veterans, from the trope of the \"haunted\" house to that of the family portrait. By bringing together the work of an international group of artists approaching home as a volatile concept, this exhibition examines how fantasies of belonging involve complex psychic and affective responses to specific material and historical conditions informed by race, gender, sexuality and class.\"Itinerant Belongings\" grounds this inquiry by revisiting critical debates that bridged activism and art in the 1980s and 1990s. Responding to the presence of the homeless, the displaced, and the disenfranchised in American cities, two of the artists in the exhibition, William Pope.L and Krzysztof Wodiczko, produced projects in this critical moment that questioned the very notion of what it meant for a space to be \"public.\" This exhibition aims to reanimate this dialogue and extend it to a contemporary global landscape marked by mass displacement, armed conflict, and debates around borders and immigration.Work by Yael Bartana, Jamie Diamond, Andrew Moore, William Pope.L, Paul Salveson, Jessica Vaughn, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, and Krzysztof Wodiczko will be on display at Slought and the Addams Gallery at PennDesign, and viewers are encouraged to take an itinerant path from one exhibition site to another.\nMore information", "endtime": "", "event_index": 468, "location": "Slought, 4017 Walnut Street, PhiladelphiaAddams Fine Arts Hall, 200 S. 36th Street, Philadelphia", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "", "title": "Itinerant Belongings", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/itinerant-belongings"},

How do their patterns provide protective camouflage in tropical rain forests? How is nanotechnology using the waterproofing properties of butterfly colors to fabricate energy-efficient materials for buildings? In this panel discussion, Penn researchers discuss how their scientific and technological work imitates nature.\nUsing holographic lithography, Shu Yang and her Penn research team recently developed a material that mimics the iridescent and water-resistant qualities of butterfly wings. Applying this innovation, they developed a superhydrophobic coating that can be sprayed onto any surface. The solution contains nanoscopic particles that add a nearly invisible layer of roughness to a surface. Among other things, this highly water resistant coating is now being used on solar panels to keep them drier, cleaner and more efficient.\nIn 2004, Shu Yang was named one of the World's Top 100 Innovators Under 35 by MIT Technology Review. In 2006, she received the prestigious Faculty Early Career Development Award from the National Science Foundation. And in 2011, she was selected by the National Academy of Engineering to present at the Japan-America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium.

Value with respect to color can mean the relative lightness or darkness of a hue, but can also mean aesthetic merit, political importance, moral acceptability, or material worth. The question of color's values is also fundamentally a question of sensory perception, constructed at the level of the individual synapse as well as the cultural collective. We want to consider the descriptive language of color\u2014how we evoke color with and/or through value-laden words or actions, how we assign qualities or quantities to different colors, how color is experienced through taste or touch as well as sight.Four distinguished scholars - Richard Doyle, Torkwase Dyson, Nicole Fleetwood, and Mohan Matthen - will explore the values of color from a variety of perspectives. How and why do we classify and assign values (moral, economic, social, epistemic) to particular colors, even 'people of color,' or material gradations, from light to dark? How does color function in a modern economy? What is its role in making subjectivity legible through its performance? How does color function as nonverbal communication that is affectively felt? To what degree is color a 'natural' or physical property and in what ways is it a rhetorical or cultural construction?

But we live these short life spans. Why not do the thing that's the coolest thing in the world to do? \u2014David Eagleman, The New Yorker\n\nDavid Eagleman is best known for his work on time perception, synesthesia, and neurolaw. He directs the Laboratory for Perception and Action at the Baylor College of Medicine, whose goal is to understand how the brain constructs perception, how different brains do so differently, and how this matters for society. He also founded and directs Baylor's Initiative on Neuroscience and Law, which studies how new discoveries in neuroscience should navigate the way we make laws, punish criminals, and develop rehabilitation. And, he founded and is chief scientific officer for BrainCheck, a company that uses interactive testing on portable tablets to measure brain function, which schools are using to rapidly measure concussions at the sidelines.\nIn 2011, Eagleman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and that same year won the Eric Hoffer Book Award Montaigne Medal for his book Wednesday is Indigo Blue: Discovering the Brain of Synesthesia, coauthored with Richard Cytowic. In 2012 he was named Science Educator of the Year by the Society for Neuroscience, and was featured as one of the year's Brightest Idea Guys by Italy's Style Magazine. In 2014, he received the John J. McGovern Award for Excellence in Biomedical Education from the American Medical Writers' Association.\nOne of his latest books, Livewired: How the Brain Rewrites its Own Circuitry, is due in spring 2015 (Doubleday Canada). Also in Fall 2015, Eagleman will host the new PBS science series, \"The Brain with Dr. David Eagleman.\"\nFrom the Eagleman Laboratory website, in his own words:\"Public understanding of science is a passion of mine, and to that end I have written for the New York Times, Discover Magazine, Atlantic, The Week, Slate, Wired, New Scientist, and others.

The event will take place in room 101 of the Music Building (Lerner Center, 201 South 34th Street) on Tuesday November 19th at 5:15. Reception will follow. Below please find an abstract. We look forward to seeing many of you at this talk!\n\nWhen Richard Wagner created a lowered orchestra pit at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in the 1870s he famously described the decision in terms of concealment; an attempt to hide the means of sound production. In view of the modifications made to numerous opera houses in the decades that followed to create similar orchestra pits, scholars have tended to assume that the Festspielhaus was both the stimulus and model for such spaces. If this tends to flatten out important variations in architectural design between theaters, it also narrates the introduction of orchestra pits from the perspective of audience members alone. While lowered orchestral platforms might have functioned as so-called \u201cmystical chasms\u201d from which sound floated upwards towards awed spectators, these also had a crucial role in the creation of enclosed, protected spaces for musicians.\n\nThe 1907 construction of the so-called \u201cgolfo mistico\u201d at the preeminent Teatro alla Scala in Milan, under the supervision of Arturo Toscanini, was to a considerable extent an experiment in the creation of a more professional atmosphere than performance at audience level allowed. However much the term golfo mistico betrays a Romantic conception of the space, it was not, I argue, coincidental that the pit was constructed in the same moment that trade unions for musicians were establishing themselves. Meanwhile, musicians were also becoming familiar with other sorts of enclosures calibrated to control acoustics and eliminate distractions, in the form of the earliest sound studios. Placing La Scala\u2019s golfo mistico in the context of these dual developments in the Italian music industry at the time, I reveal the extent of the orchestra pit\u2019s entanglements in a musical landscape which increasingly placed musicians at one remove from their audiences; in tandem, I offer a new framework in which to make sense of the new (and enduring) fashion for this architectural innovation.", "endtime": "06:15 PM", "event_index": 495, "location": "", "owner": "Department of Music", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:15pm", "title": "Laura Protano-Biggs on the Teatro alla Scala in Milan", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/music/events/laura-protano-biggs-teatro-alla-scala-milan"},

  {"date": "25 Oct 2019 - 12:00pm to 1:00pm", "date_dt": "25-10-2019", "description": "About the Talk\nWhy do people believe and share misinformation, including entirely fabricated news headlines (\u201cfake news\u201d) and biased or misleading coverage of actual events (\"hyper-partisan\" content)? The dominant narrative in the media and among academics is that we believe misinformation because we want to \u2014 that is, we engage in motivated reasoning, using our cognitive capacities to convince ourselves of the truth of statements that align with our political ideology rather than to undercover the truth. In a series of survey experiments using American participants, David Rand and colleagues challenged this account. They consistently found that subjects who perform better on the Cognitive Reflection Test (a measure of the tendency to engage in analytic thinking) are better able to identify false or biased headlines \u2014 even for headlines that align with individuals\u2019 political ideology (for details, see here and here). They also found that when examining actual Twitter behavior, more reflective individuals share information from higher quality news sources. These findings suggest that susceptibility to misinformation is driven more by mental laziness and lack of reasoning than it is by partisan bias hijacking the reasoning process. They then build on this observation to examine interventions to fight the spread of misinformation. In one, they show that laypeople are much less biased in their evaluation of the trustworthiness of news outlets than one might imagine, and give fake news and hyperpartisan outlets low trust ratings regardless of their political slant. Thus, using crowdsourced ratings of outlet quality to inform social media ranking algorithms is a promising approach (for details, see here). Second, the researchers demonstrate the power of making the concept of accuracy top-of-mind, thereby increasing the likelihood that people think about the accuracy of headlines before they decide whether to share them. Rand's results suggest that reasoning is not held hostage by partisan bias, but that instead participants do have the ability to tell fake or inaccurate from real \u2014 if they bother to pay attention. The findings also suggest simple, cost-effective behavioral interventions to fight the spread of misinformation.\nAbout the Speaker\nDavid G. Rand is the Erwin H. Schell Professor and an Associate Professor of Management Science and Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT Sloan, and the Director of the Human Cooperation Laboratory and the Applied Cooperation Team.\nBridging the fields of behavioral economics and psychology, Rand\u2019s research combines mathematical/computational models with human behavioral experiments and online/field studies to understand human behavior. His work uses a cognitive science perspective grounded in the tension between more intuitive versus deliberative modes of decision-making, and explores topics such as cooperation/prosociality, punishment/condemnation, perceived accuracy of false or misleading news stories, political preferences, and the dynamics of social media platform behavior. His work has been published in peer-reviewed journals such Nature, Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, the American Economic Review, Psychological Science, and Management Science.

If infrastructure conditions how information, people, and things circulate, then what might the practices of concealment tell us about the political stakes of circulation, and about the nature of our infrastructural surround? What kinds of visual forms emerge in global media events in which concealment is crucial part, sometimes even the condition of possibility for targetable people and equipment to stay on air. This colloquium examines these contradictions in the context of Lebanon, where infrastructural disrepair and breakdown parallel political impasses and fragmentation. It takes the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year as its case study. Based on fieldwork and visual analysis, El-Hibri examines how concealment structures phenomena ranging from live satellite news broadcasts, drone-cam footage, signal jamming and hacking, and online guerilla video from the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year. He shows how televisual liveness in this event \u2014 that new-again promise to see things faraway as they happen \u2014 demonstrates how the geopolitics of simultaneity has transformed in the contemporary moment.\nAbout the Speaker\nHatim El-Hibri is a\u00a0Faculty Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication and an\u00a0Assistant Professor of Film and Media at George Mason University.

In his book,\u00a0The Palestinian Idea, Greg Burris argues that it is precisely through film and media that hope can occasionally emerge amidst hopelessness, emancipation amidst oppression, freedom amidst apartheid. The author employs the work of Edward W. Said, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, and Cedric J. Robinson in order to locate Palestinian utopia in the heart of the Zionist present. He analyzes the films of prominent directors Annemarie Jacir (Salt of This Sea,\u00a0When I Saw You) and Hany Abu-Assad (Paradise Now) to investigate the emergence and formation of Palestinian identity. Looking at Mais Darwazah\u2019s documentary\u00a0My Love Awaits Me by the Sea, Burris considers the counterhistories that make up the Palestinian experience\u2014stories and memories that have otherwise been obscured or denied. He also examines Palestinian (in)visibility in the global media landscape, and how issues of Black-Palestinian transnational solidarity are illustrated through social media, staged news spectacles, and hip hop music.\u00a0\n\"A deeply felt, brilliantly conceived, meticulously crafted book,\u00a0The Palestinian Idea\u00a0breaks new ground in how we understand vision, space, and identity.

How is certain novel information about the world nevertheless made meaningful in their everyday lives? While a growing number of studies have focused on the role of multi-platform mobile technology in young people\u2019s daily experiences, few studies have aimed to reconceptualize news from this perspective, paying particular attention to the phenomenology of news perception in the digital age. Such a reconceptualization is all the more important since the basic dimensions of phenomenology \u2013 namely, time, space and cultural relevance \u2013 coincide with the basic dimensions of news as a cultural form. This talk will draw from ongoing fieldwork with college students in Kazan, Russia, focusing particularly on the challenges of conducting a \u201cnews reception\u201d study when what counts as \u201cnews\u201d is not separable from the rest of their coming-of-age experiences on and offline.\nNatalia Roudakova is a cultural anthropologist (Ph.D., Stanford University, 2007) working in the fields of political communication, journalism, and media studies, with an interest in moral philosophy and political and cultural theory.

Through a consideration of the television set\u2019s intertwining with devices ranging from VCRs to set-top boxes and optical-fiber cables, Chirumamilla exposes new veins of analysis through which we might understand both the inter-media history within which television in South India is embedded and the kinds of mediated futures that television\u2019s material transformations portend.\n\u00a0\nFollowing an overview of her larger project, which utilizes both ethnographic research and close textual analysis of newspapers, enthusiast magazines, and policy documents, Chirumamilla will turn her focus to the objects of the television set, the videotape, and the VCR. How does looking at these objects in concert with each other change our imagining of the historical trajectory of television in South India? She will argue that the television set\u2019s entanglement with videotapes and the VCR is illustrative of the contentious, close relationship between the commercial cinema industry and television\u2019s growing presence within the lives of Indian media consumers; an entanglement that has so far gone understudied and might offer us new ways to think about how we theorize the pasts and futures of media technologies.\n\u00a0\n\nAbout the Speaker\nPadma Chirumamilla\u00a0is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication. Her work examines how media infrastructures shape and are shaped by everyday cultural life and labor in postcolonial South India and the broader Global South. Her dissertation investigates how the television \u2014 both the physical object and the broader media entity \u2014 were integrated into the daily rhythms of viewers and media workers in small-town and rural regions in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, through venues like the repair shop and technologies likes the videotape and VCR. Through a combination of ethnographic and textually-based methods, Chirumamilla\u2019s research considers how the materiality of media shapes its absorption into the routines and rhythms of everyday life in the Global South. She is also interested in notions of technological futurity, and how the futuristic allure of digital technologies configures everyday encounters with media infrastructures in the Global South.

In this presentation, I present the concept of the \u201cNew\u00a0Jim\u00a0Code\" to explore a range of discriminatory designs that encode inequity: by explicitly amplifying racial hierarchies, by ignoring but thereby replicating social divisions, or by aiming to fix racial bias but ultimately doing quite the opposite. We will also consider how race itself is a kind of tool designed to stratify and sanctify social injustice and discuss how technology is and can be used toward liberatory ends. This presentation takes us into the world of biased bots, altruistic algorithms, and their many entanglements, and provides conceptual tools to decode\u00a0tech promises with sociologically informed skepticism. In doing so, it challenges us to question not only the technologies we are sold, but also the ones we manufacture ourselves.\nAbout Ruha Benjamin\nRuha Benjamin is an Associate Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University, where she studies the social dimensions of science, technology, and medicine.

While conventional wisdom often takes a dim view of nonconvex optimization algorithms due to their susceptibility to spurious local minima, simple iterative methods such as gradient descent have been remarkably successful in practice. The theoretical footings, however, had been largely lacking until recently. This talk presents two recent stories about nonconvex statistical estimation, which highlight the important role of statistical models in enabling efficient nonconvex optimization. The first story is about randomly initialized nonconvex methods for a phase retrieval problem: even without careful initialization, simple algorithms like gradient descent provably find the global solution within a logarithmic number of iterations. The second story is concerned with uncertainty quantification for nonconvex low-rank matrix completion. We develop a de-biased estimator \u2014 on the basis of a nonconvex estimate \u2014 that enables optimal construction of confidence intervals for the missing entries of the unknown matrix. All of this is achieved via a leave-one-out statistical analysis framework, which is very powerful in handling and decoupling complicated statistical dependency.\nThis is joint work with Cong Ma, Yuling Yan, Yuejie Chi, and Jianqing Fan.", "endtime": "4:00 PM", "event_index": 666, "location": "Room 401B, 3401 Walnut,  3401 Walnut Street", "owner": "School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS)", "speaker": "Yuxin Chen\nAssistant Professor in Electrical Engineering at Princeton University\nYuxin Chen is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University.

  {"date": "October 28 2019", "date_dt": "28-10-2019", "description": "Abstract: Quadrotors and multirotors in general are common in many inspection and surveillance applications. For these applications, visual-inertial odometry is a common way to localize the vehicles and observe the environment. However, unlike with wheeled mobile robots, quadrotor localization algorithms often do not use knowledge of the control inputs and the full vehicle dynamics as a process model for localization. Rather, they use kinematic models, with the IMU providing acceleration and angular velocity. One of the reasons for avoiding the use of dynamics is that, until recently quadrotor aerodynamic effects have not been considered in the literature and hence the dynamic models for quadrotors have been less accurate than those for wheeled mobile robots. The main aerodynamic terms that are significant are first-order effects that are linear in velocity and angular velocity. They are predominantly caused by aerodynamic interaction with the spinning propellers. This work investigates the models for such effects, as well as what can be gained if such aerodynamic effects are incorporated into the dynamic model and the full dynamics are used for state estimation. We develop novel IMU-based filters, the end results of which are used to estimate the wind velocity of the quadrotor or, indoors, when the ambient wind is zero, the velocity of the quadrotor. In addition, these filters estimate the many aerodynamic parameters in the model online. They may also be used to estimate sensor biases and inertial parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these filters through experiments. We also present nonlinear observability analyses that theoretically determine the observability properties of the systems.\nCommittee Members:\nVijay Kumar, Nemirovsky Family Dean of Engineering\nAni Hsieh, Research Associate Professor, MEAM\nKostas Daniliidis,\u00a0Ruth Yalom Stone Professor, CIS\nCamillo J.

The inherently mesoscopic nature of solid-state platforms leads to a multitude of dynamics between spins, charges, vibrations and light. Implementing a high level of control on these constituents and their interactions with each other creates exciting opportunities for realizing stationary and flying qubits within the context of spin-based quantum information science, as well as investigating mesoscopic quantum systems. Quantum optics, developed originally for atomic systems, provides a very valuable toolbox for this endeavour. In this talk, I will provide a snapshot of the progress and challenges for two contrasting examples for spin-photon interfaces, namely semiconductor quantum dots and confined excitons in atomically thin materials. For the former, I will focus on a method to suppress the magnetic noise of the nuclear ensemble by an effective cooling mechanism. This method yields access to the nuclear sideband resolved regime and coherent coupling between a single electron spin and the nuclear ensemble.

The unstressed lengths and angles of the springs, as well as their stiffnesses, are the design parameters. We present a general theory to formulate the required equilibrium and stability conditions. Solutions of these equations provide specific values of the spring properties that correspond to local energy minima in all of the target configurations.

While these systems provide high-quality images, the improved functionality comes at the cost of increased size and weight. One route to reduce a system\u2019s complexity is via computational imaging, in which much of the aberration correction and functionality of the optical hardware is shifted to post-processing in the software realm. Alternatively, a designer could miniaturize the optics by replacing them with diffractive optical elements, which mimic the functionality of refractive systems in a more compact form factor. Metasurfaces are an extreme example of such diffractive elements, in which quasiperiodic arrays of resonant subwavelength optical antennas impart spatially-varying changes on a wavefront. While separately both computational imaging and metasurfaces are promising avenues toward simplifying optical systems, a synergistic combination of these fields can further enhance system performance and facilitate advanced capabilities. In this talk, I will present a method to combine these two techniques to perform full-color imaging across the whole visible spectrum [1].

  {"date": "November 8 2019", "date_dt": "08-11-2019", "description": "Abstract: Blood clot formation involves the coupled processes of platelet aggregation and coagulation, which are triggered when there is break in a blood vessel. Platelet aggregation is largely a physical process while coagulation is biochemical, consisting of a large network of reactions that culminate in the generation of the enzyme thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin, which polymerizes into fibers to form a stabilizing gel matrix in and around growing platelet aggregates. Thrombin also (re)binds directly to fibrin but this interaction, and its purpose, is not fully understood. Thrombin-fibrin binding is often described as two independent, single-step binding events, one high-affinity and one low-affinity, each through a different exosite on thrombin. However, kinetic schemes describing these single-step binding events with reported kinetic rate constants cannot explain experimentally-observed residency times of fibrin-bound thrombin. In this work, we study a bivalent, sequential-step binding scheme as an alternative to the high-affinity event, and in addition to the low-affinity one. We developed mathematical models for the single- and sequential-step schemes consisting of reaction-diffusion equations to compare to each other and to previously published experimental data. We then used Bayesian inference, in the form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo, to learn model parameter distributions from the experimental data. For the model to best fit the data, we needed an additional assumption that thrombin was irreversibly sequestered; we hypothesized that this could be due to thrombin becoming physically trapped within fibrin fibers as they formed. We also discuss how our model can be used to further probe scenarios dealing with thrombin allostery.", "endtime": "3:00 PM", "event_index": 680, "location": "Towne 337", "owner": "Penn Institute for Computational Science (PICS)", "speaker": "Karin Leiderman\nAssociate Professor, Director of Graduate Studies, Department of Applied Math & Statistics, Colorado School of Mines\nKarin Leiderman is an Associate Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Colorado School of Mines.

  {"date": "November 26 2019", "date_dt": "26-11-2019", "description": "Recent developments in nanostructured materials have demonstrated myriad desirable properties ranging from optical and mechanical metamaterials to biomanipulative surfaces. To bring these properties from the lab to the commercial space will require innovative nanomanufacturing strategies focused on scalable and cost-effective techniques. My lab, the Hybrid Micro/Nanomanufacturing Laboratory, applies the manipulation of fundamental driving forces to this challenge through combinations of top-down and bottom-up techniques for new hybrid lithographic strategies. In this seminar, I will highlight one such strategy: self-limiting electrospray deposition (SLED) of thin film microcoatings. Electrospray deposition is a well-established technique for the creation of thin films from the spray of highly charged droplets loaded with the materials to be deposited. In SLED, specific manipulation of the electrostatic repulsion, hydrodynamic forces, and evaporation kinetics can be employed to conformally cover 3D architectures with microcoatings. The generated coatings are hierarchical, possessing either nanoshell or nanowire microstructure. Having demonstrated the mechanism of the self-limiting effect, we have developed the ability to employ materials that would be otherwise incompatible with self-limiting. In this way we have incorporated a wide variety of functional systems, including: (1) biocompatible, (2) plasmonic, (3) elastomerically-toughened composite, (4) anti-corrosive epoxy or sol gel, and (5) electrically conductive coatings. We have also characterized the geometric limits of features that can be coated through this approach, showing that the 3D capabilities increase with decreasing feature size to the micron-scale. This property, combined with the hierarchical structure of the coatings, shifts the burden of micro/nanoscale resolution from a costly or slow technique to a more scalable method, thereby removing barriers for integration into advanced manufacturing techniques such as roll-to-roll or additive manufacturing.", "endtime": "12:00 PM", "event_index": 689, "location": "Glandt Forum, Singh Center for Nanotechnology,  3205 Walnut Street", "owner": "Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM)", "speaker": "Jonathan P. Singer\nAssistant Professor, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Rutgers University\nJonathan Singer obtained his PhD (2013) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and MSc and BS (2008) from the University of Pennsylvania, all in Materials Science and Engineering. His undergraduate and masters research was in hydrogen storage for fuel cell vehicles. The latter study was conducted in collaboration with General Motors Company and pursued light metal hydrides as a chemisorption solution for cyclable and efficient hydrogen storage and generation. His doctoral studies at MIT focused on the development of hybrid laser direct write methods, most significantly, the use of highly focused lasers to provide the driving force for 2D and 3D self-assembly with applications in phoXonic metamaterials. After receiving his PhD, he worked as a postdoctoral research associate in Yale University\u2019s Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering. Here, he investigated methods for the nanoimprint of photovoltaic materials and bulk metallic glass alloys, focusing on approaches that would simultaneously push the maximum aspect ratio, resolution, and 3D compatibility of the patterned features. He is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Rutgers University, where he continues to research manufacturing hierarchically-structured materials that incorporate the extraordinary properties of nanostructures into complex geometries.

Dr. Christopher Ashford, Executive Director of Penn Futures, will facilitate a discussion on James Baldwin's essay, \"A Report From Occupied Territory.\" Refreshments will be served! Baldwin, an American novelist, playwright, and activist, explored intricacies of racial, sexual, and class distinctions in Western societies. His essay,\u00a0A Report from Occupied Territory, focuses on the impact of segregated education, joblessness and police brutality in marginalized communities. Although written several decades ago, Baldwin\u2019s observations are still relevant and continue to resonate. This initiative represents one of several activities that have been established as part of HEARD (Hub for Equity, Anti-Oppression, Research, and Development). A goal of this reading group is to discuss various readings on topics that interrogate structures of power and the re/production of forms of oppression related to race, religion, gender, class, legal status, citizenship, etc., and to consider how these issues impact our work here at GSE. It is our hope that this reading group will provide opportunities for us to learn from each other as we engage in rich conversations on these topics. This year, we will be featuring essays, articles, brief videos, and short stories written by authors who have focused on various types of oppression. We will be looking for volunteers to lead future discussions. However, please note that you don\u2019t have to lead a discussion to participate.

To address this problem, we propose a paradigm shift. The current paradigm centers on generating one estimate at a time using a unique study design with unknown reliability and publishing (or not) one estimate at a time. The new paradigm advocates for high-throughput observational studies using consistent and standardized methods, allowing evaluation, calibration, and unbiased dissemination to generate a more reliable and complete evidence base. We demonstrate this new paradigm by comparing all hypertension treatments for a set of effectiveness and safety outcomes, producing 587,020 hazard ratios, each using methodology on par with state-of-the-art studies. We furthermore include control hypotheses to evaluate and calibrate our evidence generation process. Results agree with the limited number of randomized trials. The distribution of effect size estimates reported in literature reveals an absence of small or null effects, with a sharp cutoff at p = 0.05.

In simple models, causal parameters of interest are identified by variations of the functional known as the g-formula, and estimated using parametric and semi-parametric frameworks for statistical inference. Identification by the g-formula, and subsequent estimation methods in fully observed models have a clean interpretation in terms of the Markov factorization with respect to a directed acyclic graph (DAG). I show that this interpretation may be extended to arbitrary hidden variable causal models using a more involved nested Markov factorization with respect to a directed mixed graph. This view leads to a simple characterization of non-parametric identification for many parameters in causal inference, including causal effects, direct, indirect, and path-specific effects, responses to counterfactual policies, and many others. In addition, the nested Markov factorization avoids certain paradoxes associated with causal nulls, and leads to well-behaved model likelihoods that avoid making assumptions on unobserved variables, while capturing the structure these variables induce on the observed marginal distribution. This structure takes the form of all equality constraints induced by the hidden variable model, including conditional independences and \u201cVerma constraints.\u201d These restrictions may be used to make statistical inference more computationally tractable via probabilistic calculation procedures that generalize variable elimination algorithms in machine learning.", "endtime": "5:30 pm", "event_index": 799, "location": "F45 Huntsman Hall", "owner": "Wharton Statistics Seminars", "speaker": "Ilya Shpitser \u2013 Johns Hopkins University", "starttime": "4:30pm", "title": "Identification and Estimation of Causal Parameters via a Modified Factorization of a Graphical Model", "url": "https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/identification-and-estimation-of-causal-parameters-via-a-modified-factorization-of-a-graphical-model"},

In recent years graphical rules have been derived for determining, from a causal diagram, all covariate adjustment sets. Restricting attention to causal linear models, a very recent article introduced two graphical criterions: one to compare the asymptotic variance of linear regression estimators that control for certain distinct adjustment sets and a second to identify the optimal adjustment set that provides the smallest asymptotic variance. In this talk, I will show that the same graphical criterions can be used in arbitrary causal diagrams when the goal is to minimize the asymptotic variance of non-parametric estimators of ATE that ignore the causal diagram assumptions. Furthermore, I will provide a graphical criterion to determine the optimal adjustment set among the minimal adjustment sets. In addition, I will provide another graphical criterion for determining when a non-parametric estimator of ATE is as efficient as an efficient estimator that exploits the causal diagram assumptions.

Methods for assessing the\u00a0sensitivity\u00a0of a study\u2019s conclusions to unmeasured confounding have been devised for testing sharp null hypotheses, most commonly that the treatment effect is constant across all individuals.

We present a new method for\u00a0sensitivity\u00a0analysis\u00a0for the sample average treatment effect in paired observational studies while leaving the individual-level treatment effects unspecified. Our recommended procedure relates recent work on\u00a0robust\u00a0permutation tests to observational studies, where randomizations are no longer drawn uniformly. The method naturally extends conventional modes of inference for the sample average treatment effect in paired experiments to the case of unknown, but bounded, probabilities of assignment to treatment. We further assess the performance of existing methods for sensitivity analysis when the assumption of effect homogeneity is violated. In so doing, we illustrate that concerns about certain\u00a0sensitivity\u00a0analyses operating under the presumption of constant effects are largely unwarranted.", "endtime": "5:30 pm", "event_index": 801, "location": "F45 Huntsman Hall", "owner": "Wharton Statistics Seminars", "speaker": "Colin Fogarty \u2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "starttime": "4:30pm", "title": "Testing Weak Nulls in Paired Observational Studies", "url": "https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/testing-weak-nulls-in-paired-observational-studies"},

Its causal identification relies on the assumption of parallel trends, which is scale dependent and may be questionable in some applications. A common alternative is a regression model that adjusts for the lagged dependent variable, which rests on the assumption of ignorability conditional on past outcomes. In this paper, we show a general nonparametric bracketing relationship between the difference-in-differences and lagged-dependent-variable regression estimates, under testable assumptions. Namely, for a true positive effect, if ignorability is correct, then mistakenly assuming parallel trends will overestimate the effect; in contrast, if the parallel trends assumption is correct, then mistakenly assuming ignorability will underestimate the effect. This provides a general strategy to construct bounds for the treatment effects. We provide three examples to illustrate the theoretical results.

A key theoretical and practical assumption of most methods, however, is that they have access to independent samples from the entire distribution of relevant data. As such, these methods often fail catastrophically in the face of biased data which breaks this assumption. In this talk, we focus on bias due to censoring or truncation, where samples falling outside of an \u201cobservation window\u201d are unreliable or cannot be observed due e.g. to measurement errors, legal or privacy constraints, or biased data collection. We present a general framework based on stochastic gradient descent for regression and classification from truncated samples. While the framework is broadly applicable, we also instantiate it to obtain computationally and statistically efficient methods for truncated density estimation and truncated linear, logistic and probit regression in high dimensions.

This privacy definition, however, has some well-known weaknesses: notably, it does not tightly handle composition. This weakness has inspired several recent relaxations of differential privacy based on Renyi divergences. We propose an alternative relaxation of differential privacy, which we term \u201cf-DP\u201d, which has a number of nice properties and avoids some of the difficulties associated with divergence based relaxations. First, it preserves the hypothesis testing interpretation of differential privacy, which makes its guarantees easily interpretable. It allows for lossless reasoning about composition and post-processing, and notably, a direct way to analyze privacy amplification by subsampling. We define a canonical single-parameter family of definitions within our class that is termed \u201cGaussian Differential Privacy\u201d, based on hypothesis testing of two shifted normal distributions. We prove that this family is focal to f-DP by introducing a central limit theorem, which shows that the privacy guarantees of any hypothesis-testing based definition of privacy (including differential privacy) converge to Gaussian differential privacy in the limit under composition. This central limit theorem also gives a tractable analysis tool. We demonstrate the use of the tools we develop by giving an improved analysis of the privacy guarantees of noisy stochastic gradient descent.

However, it remains poorly understood under what conditions groups outperform comparable individuals, which individual attributes best predict collective performance, or how task complexity mediates these relationships. Here we describe a novel two-phase experiment in which individuals were evaluated on a series of tasks of varying complexity; then randomly assigned to solve similar tasks either in groups of different compositions or as individuals. We describe two main sets of findings. First, while groups score higher than individuals across all complexity levels, they underperform a comparably sized \"nominal group\" of independent workers. Moreover, whereas both individuals and nominal groups are more efficient than groups when the task is simple, groups are more efficient for complex tasks. Second, we find that average skill level easily dominates all other factors combined, including social perceptiveness, skill diversity, and diversity of cognitive style, independent of task complexity. Our findings help to clarify inconsistencies in the existing literature and illustrate the utility of a \"solution-oriented\" approach to identifying principles of collective performance.", "endtime": "1:20 pm", "event_index": 853, "location": "JMHH 370", "owner": "Decision Processes Colloquia (Wharton)", "speaker": "Duncan Watts\nProfessor, Operations, Information and Decisions\u00a0\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, The Wharton School", "starttime": " 12:00 ", "title": "Collective Problem-Solving of Groups Across Tasks of Varying Complexity", "url": "https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/events/dpcolloquia/"},

Beyond economic issues of when to optimally claim, individual differences in psychological preferences can also affect the claiming decision. While different strands of research have investigated the impact of heterogeneity on the claiming decision, as well as the impact of information displays and interventions on claiming intentions, there has been little work pulling together both measurement of individual differences and impacts of interventions in the same experiment. In this research, we test 1) the effectiveness of 13 different interventions meant to help consumers better reason about claiming age, 2) the role that a variety of individual differences play in claiming age intentions, and 3) interactions between interventions and individual differences on claiming age intentions. Per a preregistered design, we recruited 4,500 prescreened participants, and then analyzed intended claiming age as a linear function of the indicator variables, one for each treatment arm. We also tested each individual difference measure and 23 theoretically relevant preregistered interactions.

Here we examine an important downstream consequence of spending money on experiences: fostering social connection. In an initial experiment, consumers report feeling more kinship with someone who has made a similar experiential purchase than someone who has made a similar material purchase (or no similar purchase). This result is tied to the greater centrality of experiential purchases to the consumer's identity. A follow-up experiment explores whether the greater sense of social connection that experiences provide applies even in situations in which someone else has made a similar, but superior purchase-when negative comparisons to others are brought to mind. Next, we find that people feel more connected to others in general, not just those who have made the same purchase, when they reflect on their experiential consumption. We then demonstrate that these feelings of connection are behaviorally expressed in a greater desire to engage in social activities when participants are primed about their experiences than when primed about their possessions.", "endtime": "1:20 pm", "event_index": 860, "location": "JMHH 370", "owner": "Decision Processes Colloquia (Wharton)", "speaker": "Amit Kumar\nAssistant Professor, Marketing\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, McCombs School of Business", "starttime": " 12:00 ", "title": "The Aptly Buried \u201cI\u201d in Experience: Experiential Purchases Foster Social Connection", "url": "https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/events/dpcolloquia/"},

Finally, we formally test whether the Airbnb effect is due to the reallocation of the housing supply.Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that, while the total supply of housing is not affected by the entry of Airbnb, Airbnb listings increase the supply of short-term rental units and decrease the supply of long-term rental units.", "endtime": "1:20 pm", "event_index": 864, "location": "JMHH 741 Conference Room (unless otherwise noted)", "owner": "Marketing Department Colloquia (Wharton)", "speaker": "Davide Proserpio", "starttime": " 12:00 noon ", "title": "Thursday, September 5, 2019 ~ Speaker: Davide Proserpio", "url": "https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/events/marketing-colloquia-2019-2020/"},

While these ads have excellent user-tracking properties through mobile device IDs, they have raised concerns among privacy advocates. This has resulted in an ongoing debate on the value of different types of targeting information, the incentives of ad-networks to engage in behavioral targeting, and the role of regulation. To answer these questions, we propose a unified modeling framework that consists of two components -a machine learning framework for targeting and an analytical auction model for examining market outcomes under counterfactual targeting regimes. We apply our framework to large-scale data from the leading in-app ad-network of an Asian country. We find that an efficient targeting policy based on our machine learning framework improves the average click-through rate by 66.80% over the current system.

Extant research has examined behavior-based price discrimination (BBP), that is, how firms set different prices for repeat and new customers. This research extends the literature by investigating behavior-based quality discrimination to reveal the unique effects of quality discrimination beyond the effects of BBP. Using a two-period game-theoretic model, we find that firms reward repeat customers on the quality dimension by offering them higher-quality product features or services than what new customers receive. Such quality discrimination dissuades competitive poaching, softens second-period price competition, and increases second-period profits. Meanwhile, firms reward new customers on the price dimension by offering them a lower price than what repeat customers pay. Therefore, firms should reward different types of customers with the right attribute (i.e., product features or services versus price). In addition, quality discrimination increases customer retention in the second period. Anticipating this outcome, forward-looking firms reduce first-period prices to compete aggressively for initial customers. This effect intensifies first-period competition and reduces first-period profits.Overall, behavior-based quality discrimination decreases firms' total profits but increases consumer surplus and social welfare.", "endtime": "1:20 pm", "event_index": 867, "location": "JMHH 741 Conference Room (unless otherwise noted)", "owner": "Marketing Department Colloquia (Wharton)", "speaker": "Krista Li", "starttime": " 12:00 noon ", "title": "Thursday, October 24, 2019 ~ Speaker: Krista Li", "url": "https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/events/marketing-colloquia-2019-2020/"},

The model features a large developed economy, which lends to a large number of developing economies, using long run bonds that can be defaulted on. The key feature of the model is the presence of long run risk (as in Bansal and Yaron, 2006). We first show that the model can account for the dynamics of several real variables and of sovereign spreads in the cross section of developing economies. We then use the model for examining how much of the fluctuations in spreads in developing economies arise from the changes in long risk in the developed economy (the price of risk), v/s changes in long run risk in the developing economies themselves (the quantity of risk). We find that 2/3 of fluctuations in spreads are explained by the quantity of risk.

We build on the capitalization approach in Saez and Zucman (2016) while accounting for heterogeneity within asset classes when mapping income flows to wealth. Our approach reduces bias in wealth estimates because wealth and rates of return are correlated. Overall, wealth is very concentrated: the top 1% holds as much wealth as the bottom 90%. However, the \"P90-99\" class holds more wealth than either group after accounting for heterogeneity. Relative to a top 0.1% wealth share of more than 20% under equal returns, we estimate a top 0.1% wealth share of [15%] and find that the rise since 1980 in top wealth shares falls by [half]. Top portfolios depend less on fixed income and public equity, depend more on private equity and housing, and more closely match the composition reported in the SCF and estate tax returns. Our adjustments reduce mechanical revenue estimates from a wealth tax and top capital income shares in distributional national accounts, which depend on well-measured estimates of top wealth.

Using panel data covering 1998-2011, I find that the introduction of a European wide emission standard coincides with a 14% drop in emission ratings, of which 30% is explained by technology adoption and 70% by gaming. I estimate a structural model to find that the regulation missed its emission target and was not welfare improving. Abatement with sales-mixing would have reduced emissions, but at high costs.

Using exogenous variation in electricity prices, we estimate farmers' price elasticities of demand for both electricity (-1:17) and groundwater (1:12) to be much larger than previous estimates in the literature.

Instead, they increasingly rely on schemes that face less public resistance, such as driving restrictions or license-plate bans, notwithstanding the literature has shown they typically result in more congestion and pollution by encouraging the purchase of additional, older, and more polluting vehicles. With the help of a transport model calibrated to capture Santiago's current congestion and pollution reality, we advance a restriction proposal that prevents the purchase of additional vehicles while leaving consumers of all income groups better off: driving restrictions with toll and vintage exemptions, where the toll collection is spent in public-transport fare reductions and quality improvements. A driver of a restricted car has always the option to pay a toll (daily pass) to have it exempted, but as long as the car's pollution level is below a certain threshold. Under the more ambitious format ---five days restriction, 14 dollars toll, and 2000 and 2005 vintage thresholds for petrol and diesel, respectively--- per-year net benefits from lighter traffic and cleaner air amount to 1200 million dollars (almost 0.5% of the country's GDP).", "endtime": "09:00 PM", "event_index": 892, "location": "Kleinman Center classroom\u2014Fisher Fine Arts Room 306", "owner": "Energy Economics & Finance Seminar", "speaker": "CANCELED: Juan Pablo Montero (PUC-Chile)", "starttime": "08:00 PM", "title": "CANCELED: Juan Pablo Montero (PUC-Chile)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/energy-economics-finance-seminar/"},

We combine a unique dataset, which details search behavior for a large sample of mortgage borrowers, with loan application and rejection decisions. Our data reveal substantial dispersion in mortgage rates and search intensity, conditional on observables.  However, in contrast to predictions of standard search models, we find a novel non-monotonic relationship between search and realized prices: borrowers, who search a lot, obtain more expensive mortgages than borrowers' with less frequent search. The evidence suggests that this occurs because lenders screen borrowers' creditworthiness, rejecting unworthy borrowers, which differentiates consumer credit markets from other search markets. Based on these insights, we build a model that combines search and screening in presence of asymmetric information.  Risky borrowers internalize the probability that their application is rejected, and behave as if they had higher search costs.  The model rationalizes the positive relationship between search and interest rates, and highlights the tight link between credit standards and pricing. We estimate the parameters of the model and study several counterfactuals. The model suggests that _overpayment_ may be a poor proxy for consumer unsophistication since it partly represents rational search in presence of rejections. Moreover, the development of improved screening technologies from an abundance of data endogenously leads to more severe adverse selection in credit markets.  Finally, place based policies, such as the Community Reinvestment Act, may affect equilibrium prices through endogenous search responses rather than increased credit risk.", "endtime": "09:00 PM", "event_index": 907, "location": "The Ronald O.

The framework's usefulness and theoretical founding make it a valuable starting point for analyzing misallocations. However, we show this approach is sensitive to model misspecification. The model's mapping from observed production behaviors to isallocative wedges/distortions holds in a single theoretical case, with strict assumptions required on both the demand and supply sides. We demonstrate that applying the HK methodology when there is any deviation from these assumptions will mean \"distortions\" recovered from the data may not be signs of inefficiency. Rather, they may simply reflect demand shifts or movements of the firm along its marginal cost curve, quite possibly in profitable directions. The framework may then not just spuriously identify inefficiencies; it might be more likely to do so precisely for businesses better in some fundamental way than their competitors. Empirical tests in our data, which allow us to separate price and quantity and as such directly test the model's assumptions, suggest the framework's necessary conditions do not hold. We then extend the HK framework to allow for more general demand and supply structures to quantify the discrepancy between the framework and the data. We find substantial deviations, particularly on the demand side. Using a decomposition derived from our extended framework, we find that much of the variation in revenue-based TFP (the measure of distortions in HK) reflects the influence of demand shifts, either directly or through distortions correlated with those shifts. We furthermore show that under general conditions, the variance of revenue-based TFP is not a sufficient statistic for efficiency losses due to misallocation.\u00a0", "endtime": "09:00 PM", "event_index": 910, "location": "The Ronald O.

Further, a model that omits consumer inertia tends to overstate the marginal effect of competition on price, relative to a benchmark that accounts for consumer dynamics.

Influential research, based on high-quality surveys and ethnographic work, suggests that eviction may not only be a symptom of poverty but may, in fact, cause or exacerbate poverty by contributing to circumstances that are adverse to economic mobility. Yet households facing eviction are likely to have recently faced negative economic shocks, which makes establishing the proposed causal relationship difficult. This paper proposes a quasi-experimental design for evaluating the causal impact of eviction on employment, earnings, public assistance receipt, financial distress, and children's schooling outcomes. Using over 700,000 eviction case histories, our research design leverages Cook County's random assignment of eviction court cases to judges, where some judges are more lenient than others.

This paper provides an analysis of state-sponsored auto-enrollment plans and how their default contribution rates affect employee saving behavior. OregonSaves is a plan that mandates employers to provide access to OregonSaves if they offer no employer-sponsored plan. Using these data, we show that about half of workers provided access to OregonSaves participate, and around three-quarters of participants save at the default 5% contribution rate. We also develop a model of the optimal default contribution rate using an empirically implementable sufficient statistics framework. The optimal default rate is shaped by the marginal welfare internality of savings due to the underestimation of future utility, and the marginal welfare internality of action due to the overestimation of the cost of switching to a non-default saving option. We also discuss the implications of default saving policies taking into account Social Security and means-tested social transfers.

Her preferences are correlated across products. We build on techniques from the machine learning literature on probabilistic models of matrix factorization, extending the methods to account for time-varying product attributes, a more realistic functional form for price sensitivity, and products going out of stock. We incorporate the information about the product hierarchy, so that consumers are assumed to select at most one alternative within a category. We show that our model improves over traditional modeling approaches that consider each category in isolation, when we evaluate the ability of the model to predict responsiveness to price changes (using held-out data from a large number of price changes that occurred in our sample). We show that one source of the improvement is the ability of the model to accurately estimate heterogeneity in preferences (by pooling information across categories); another source of improvement is its ability to estimate the preferences of consumers who have rarely or never made a purchase in a given category in the training data.

As a result, coverage of such services is least valuable in the states of the world in which marginal utility is greatest -- an anti-insurance effect.  Whether the net effect of health insurance is to improve or worsen risk exposure depends on the insured's relative exposure to health versus non-health risks.

I leverage novel social security administrative data on the universe\u00a0 of survivor insurance payments in Italy, and useful quasi-experimental variation in the benefits received by surviving spouses on the basis of their spouse's death date. I implement a regression discontinuity design in spousal death date to identify the effect of unearned income on labor supply, earnings and program substitution. Benefit losses trigger tantamount increases in earned income, implying a marginal propensity to earn out of unearned income of approximately -1. Extensive-margin responses - in the form of both increased labor-market entry by younger survivors and delayed retirement by older survivors - emerge as the main driving force behind the income response. Program substitution also appears to be a relevant margin of adjustment. I consider alternative explanations for the large income response. Finally, I discuss the normative implications of my findings. I propose a revealed-preference approach to estimate the value\u00a0 of transfers based on participation responses.

The Case of Unlimited Vacation\nABSTRACT: This paper addresses the birth of risky perks that endow flexibility and autonomy to workers in startup companies. While potentially offering recruitment and performance benefits to firms, these perks also come with two types of risks--agency risks due to the possibility of abuse as well as social risks that may limit the extent of gains. Focusing on an increasingly popular perk--unlimited vacation, this paper adopts a multi-method approach and ask: Does unlimited vacation benefit firms, and how? What can firms do to minimize the risks? Motivated by a content analysis, I develop a theoretical model that formalizes conjectures about the micro-foundations for using unlimited vacation to maximize the value of human assets. Predictions are tested in two studies. Study 1 conducts a randomized controlled experiment with an online labor market through a one-month job. In a 2x3x2 design, I vary (i) worker ability (high or low) (ii) work contract (unlimited vacation, capped vacation, or a choice between the two), and (iii) firing threat (strong or weak). I find that unlimited vacation (1) is three times more attractive to high ability workers, (2) increases worker productivity by 20-30%, or 51% when bundled with other practices, and (3) induces extra outputs from happier workers. An organizational system with a strong firing threat reduces slacking rate by 45%. Study 2 confirms the recruitment and performance benefits using a panel of employee survey and vacation data from a large technology firm. In addition, I find that supportive social dynamics (i.e., team and manager relationships) strengthen the gains in the performance stage.

We study this trade-off using a large reform to the U.S. bankruptcy code which raised the cost of filing for bankruptcy and reduced the benefits of filing for many consumers. We find that the reform significantly reduced aggregate bankruptcy filings. Using a combination of administrative records, proprietary market-research data, and credit reports, we estimate pass-through to borrowing costs and the consequences for the insurance value of bankruptcy. We estimate that a one-percentage-point reduction in filing risk within a credit score segment translates to a 67 basis-point decline in the offered interest rate for unsecured credit. Based on a simple model of interest rate setting, this represents approximately 73% pass-through relative to a perfect competition benchmark. After the reform, large negative financial shocks--in particular, uninsured hospitalizations--are\u00a0less than half as likely to be discharged through bankruptcy.

Much of it is spent through \\scaling\" procurement auctions, in which private construction firms submit unit price bids for each piece of material required to complete a project. The winner is determined by the lowest total cost|given government estimates of the amount of each material needed|but, critically, they are paid based on the realized quantities used. This creates an incentive for firms to skew their bids|bidding high when they believe the government is underestimating an item's quantity and vice versa|and raises concerns of rent-extraction among policymakers. For risk averse bidders, however, scaling auctions provide a distinctive way to generate surplus: they enable firms to limit their risk exposure by placing lower unit bids on items with greater uncertainty. To assess this effect empirically, we develop a structural model of scaling auctions with risk averse bidders. Using data on bridge maintenance projects undertaken by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT), we present evidence that bidding behavior is consistent with optimal skewing under risk aversion. We then estimate bidders' risk aversion, the risk in each auction, and the distribution of bidders' private costs. Finally, we simulate equilibrium item-level bids under counterfactual settings to estimate the fraction of MassDOT spending that is due to risk and evaluate alternative mechanisms under consideration by MassDOT. We find that scaling auctions provide substantial savings to MassDOT relative to lump sum auctions and suggest several policies that might improve on the status quo.", "endtime": "06:30 PM", "event_index": 943, "location": "265 JMHH", "owner": "Applied Economics Workshop (Wharton)", "speaker": "Shoshana Vasserman (Harvard)", "starttime": "05:00 PM", "title": "Shoshana Vasserman (Harvard)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/"},

Conversely, strong property rights over innovations can impede cumulative research and lead to inefficient duplication of effort. These effects are particularly acute in natural resource exploration, where discoveries are spatially correlated and property rights over neighboring regions are allocated to competing firms. I use data from offshore oil exploration in the UK to quantify the effects of information externalities on the speed and efficiency of exploration by estimating a dynamic structural model of the firm's exploration problem. Firms drill exploration wells to learn about the spatial distribution of oil and face a trade-off between drilling now and delaying exploration to learn from other firms' wells. I show that removing the incentive to free ride brings exploration forward by about 1 year and increases industry surplus by 31%. Allowing perfect information flow between firms raises industry surplus by a further 38%. Counterfactual policy simulations highlight the trade off between discouraging free riding and encouraging cumulative research - stronger property rights over exploration well data increase the rate of exploration, while weaker property rights increase the efficiency and speed of learning but reduce the rate of exploration.

I find that previously inaccessible areas add twice as many net new restaurants in the post period than in the pre-period, boosting net creation rates from 4% to 8%. I find no response in industries less sensitive to travel choice, such as dentists or dry cleaners. These results are robust to a variety of inaccessibility definitions, are not driven by the most public transit reliant cities, and show no evidence of industry dispersion in the pre-period. As these areas become more productive and desirable, house prices rise by 11-15% on average, as firms and residents compete for newly desirable locations. Tracking travel patterns, emissions increase by 11% in formerly inaccessible areas, and in New York City, travelers are 9% more likely to be dropped off by taxi in inaccessible locations; both consistent with consumers' substituting away from public transit in favor of private cars to access new locations. Put together, a 9-11% increase in travel is associated with a 4% additional growth in restaurants. I frame these reduced form results using a modified spatial equilibrium framework, in which resident welfare depends on the trade-off between accessibility benefits and housing costs.

We propose a hypothesis to reconcile these two trends: that when they are making key human capital decisions, women in modern cohorts underestimate the impact of motherhood on their future labor supply. Using an event-study framework, we show substantial and persistent employment effects of motherhood in U.K. and U.S. data. We then provide evidence that women do not anticipate these effects. Upon becoming parents, women (and especially more educated women) adopt more negative views toward female employment (e.g., they are more likely to say that women working hurts family life), suggesting that motherhood serves as an information shock to their beliefs. Women on average (and, again, more educated women in particular) report that parenthood is harder than they expected. We then look at longer horizons--are young women's expectations about future labor supply correct when they make their key educational decisions? In fact, female high school seniors are increasingly and substantially overestimating the likelihood they will be in the labor market in their thirties, a sharp reversal from previous cohorts who substantially underestimated their future labor supply. Finally, we specify a model of women's choice of educational investment in the face of uncertain employment costs of motherhood, which demonstrates that our results can be reconciled only if these costs increased unexpectedly across generations.

Although theory predicts delays should be associated with improvements in the quality of the match, we find no changes in the quality of the matches. Also contrary to theory, we find no changes in the lifetime fertility and work behavior of the mother. We do find that recipients were less likely to move away from their county of residence.

While there is a vast literature on UI, SP programs have received much less attention, even though they are prevalent across countries and predominant in developing countries. In particular, little is known about the insurance value that they provide to displaced workers, which critically relies on workers' ability to optimally dissave their lump-sum amount after layoff. We follow a standard approach in the UI literature that evaluates workers' need for insurance and the insurance value of policies by studying workers' consumption profile after layoff. We exploit a rare combination of de-identified high-frequency expenditure data and matched employee-employer data in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, where displaced workers are eligible for both UI and SP. Our main finding is that workers increase consumption at layoff by 35% despite experiencing a long-term consumption loss of 17% when they stop receiving any benefits. We refer to ``consumption'' because these patterns are robust across expenditure categories, and are not driven by durable goods. Moreover, the excess sensitivity of consumption to cash-on-hand is present across a rich set of policy variation in UI benefits and SP amounts. We show that a simple dynamic model of job search and consumption with present-bias agents is consistent with both reemployment and consumption patterns in our data. We then use this model to illustrate the usual incentive-insurance trade-off under counterfactual job displacement insurance designs. Our findings highlight the importance of the difference between SP and UI in their disbursement policy when consumption is highly sensitive to the timing of benefit payment -- beyond their different contingency policy -- and shed new light on the need for job displacement insurance in a developing country context.\u00a0", "endtime": "06:30 PM", "event_index": 959, "location": "265 JMHH", "owner": "Applied Economics Workshop (Wharton)", "speaker": "Joana Naritomi (LSE)", "starttime": "05:00 PM", "title": "Joana Naritomi (LSE)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/"},

To overcome the fact that factors that affect a worker's outside options may also impact her productivity at her current job, we develop a strategy that isolates changes in a worker's information about her outside options. This strategy relies on the fact that individuals often learn about jobs through social networks, including former coworkers. We implement this strategy using employer-employee data from Denmark that contain monthly information on wages and detailed measures of worker skills. We find that increases in labor demand at former coworkers' current firms lead to job-to-job mobility and wage growth. Consistent with theory, larger changes are necessary to induce a job-to-job transition than to induce a wage gain. Specification tests leveraging alternative sources of variation suggest these responses are indeed due to information rather than unobserved demand shocks.

Simplified policies can be characterized without complete backward induction to compute promised utilities when the time horizon is finite. However, linear policies can be far from optimal. Equilibria in decentralized versions of these economies are not generally efficient, implying a meaningful role for government provision of insurance, unlike in conventional environments with a narrower view of uncertainty.", "endtime": "06:30 PM", "event_index": 963, "location": "265 JMHH", "owner": "Applied Economics Workshop (Wharton)", "speaker": "Max Troshkin (Cornell)", "starttime": "05:00 PM", "title": "Max Troshkin (Cornell)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/"},

Conceptually, the effects of interest rate caps are ambiguous and depend on a trade-off between consumer protection from banks' market power and reductions in credit access. We exploit a policy in Chile that lowered interest rate caps by 20 percentage points to understand its impacts. Using comprehensive individual-level administrative data, we document that the policy decreased transacted interest rates by 9%, but also reduced the number of loans by 19%. To estimate the welfare effects of this policy, we develop and estimate a model of loan applications, pricing, and repayment of loans. Consumer surplus decreases by an equivalent of 3.5% of average income, with larger losses for risky borrowers. Survey evidence suggests these welfare effects may be driven by decreased consumption smoothing and increased financial distress. Interest rate caps provide greater consumer protection in more concentrated markets, but welfare effects are negative even under a monopoly. Risk-based regulation reduces the adverse effects of interest rate caps, but does not eliminate them.", "endtime": "06:30 PM", "event_index": 964, "location": "265 JMHH", "owner": "Applied Economics Workshop (Wharton)", "speaker": "Jose Ignacio Cuesta (Chicago)", "starttime": "05:00 PM", "title": "Jose Ignacio Cuesta (Chicago)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/"},

We compare areas that initially had high or low levels of immigrants from quota-restricted countries before and after the border closure.

With considerable guidance from Dave Morrison, Sakura Sch\u00e4fer-Nameki, and Tony Pantev, we were finally led to overcome this difficulty by re-examining two peices of the puzzle: 1) the Narasihham-Seshadri equivalence that equates flat E_8(real) bundles with flat complex holomorphic complex E_8(complex) vector bundles on a Riemann surface, 2) the properties of the Tate form that govern the evolution of symmetry-breaking from the initial E_8 x E_8 state that allow the Tate form (with the help of the Jacobson-Morosov theorem) to uniquely determine an explicit deformation of the E_8 rational double-point singularity. We notice in 1) that there are actually two (conjugate) complex structures that can be assigned to the given real bundle, With repect to 2) we apply the Brieskorn-Grothendieck equivariant crepant resolution of the E_8 rational double-point singularity.

An interesting question is to learn the laws of interaction between the particles/agents from data consisting of trajectories. In the case of distance-based interaction laws, we present efficient regression algorithms to estimate the interaction functions, and we develop a systematic nonparametric statistical learning theory addressing identifiability, consistency and optimal rate of convergence of the estimators. In particular, we use the theory to guide the design of the regression algorithms, quantification of the uncertainty in estimations, and criteria for statistical model selection.

He graduated from the University of Kansas in 2013, and he was Postdoctoral Fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and the University of California, Berkeley in 2013-2017. His current research focuses on learning dynamics from data, including applications as well as the mathematical foundations. In particular, he is working on the nonparametric inference of interaction functions in systems of interacting particles/agents, and on model reduction for complex multi-scale systems along with applications in data assimilation and Monte Carlo sampling.", "endtime": "03:00 PM", "event_index": 994, "location": "A6  DRL", "owner": "Department of Mathematics (Math)", "speaker": "Fei Lu, Johns Hopkins University", "starttime": "2:00pm", "title": "Nonparametric Inference of Interaction Laws in Systems of Particles/Agents", "url": "https://www.math.upenn.edu/events/nonparametric-inference-interaction-laws-systems-particlesagents"},

Join Perry World House for a screening of Breathe in the Roots, a documentary telling the story of Joseph\u2019s journey of discovery, traveling across Ethiopia on horseback. \nThe screening will be followed by a discussion with Joseph and filmmaker Indrias Kassaye (\u201992) about using storytelling as a tool for understanding complex global issues, moderated by global education consultant and Penn lecturer Anastasia Shown. \nThis event is hosted in partnership with Makuu, International Student & Scholar Services, the School of Social Policy and Practice, and Penn\u2019s International Relations Program. \nSPEAKERS\nIndrias G. Kassaye is a communication strategist, photographer, and documentary filmmaker from Ethiopia. After completing his studies at the University of Pennsylvania in 1992, Kassaye returned to Ethiopia to pursue a career in development. Career highlights include work as a photojournalist; as a communications\u00a0specialist with UNICEF in Ethiopia, and Sierra Leone during the Ebola epidemic; and as a multi-media producer for UN agencies and NGOs in various African countries. He is also the author of Beyond the Throne: The Enduring Legacy of Haile Selassie I. Kassaye moved to the United States in 2016 where he has been pursuing opportunities to build bridges between Africa and the United States through exhibitions, film screenings, and productions designed to promote exchange, understanding and mutual empowerment.\nTy Christen Joseph is an educator and social worker living in New York City. Before completing his masters, he worked as an English and\u00a0debate instructor and entrepreneur for eight years, while studying and traveling through Costa Rica, South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Egypt, and Ethiopia. Joseph works with different groups to organize against the criminalization of poverty and people with disabilities, in addition to anti-Black racism and Afrophobic policies in academia, sociopolitical, and international spheres. He employs tactical civil disobedience, curricula design, and direct action to push institutions towards social justice frameworks that empower and enthrall marginalized communities towards the creation of an equitable society. His practice centers around critical race theory, radical pedagogy, and decolonial theory.\u202f\nMODERATOR\nAnastasia Shown\u00a0is a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania\u00a0and a global education consultant.

The works range from papers to presentations, job talks, films, podcasts, or art projects.

This figure has steadily crept up over the last decade. Yet, even as nearly a third of employed Americans depend on this \u201ccontingent employment\u201d, these ad-hoc \u201cjobs\u201d are woefully under addressed by contemporary labor laws. Consequentially, a large swarth of American workers are forced to depend on severely inequitable employment relationships which can be terminated at the whim of the gig company, often with little or no explanation.\nThis situation is untenable. To this end, this talk aims to offer two potential avenues for agitating for better legal protections and work cultures for those who participate in gig work. I begin by detailing my own participation as a named plaintiff in\u00a0Singer et al. v Postmates, which put $8 million back in the hands of gig workers who we, the plaintiffs, alleged had been misclassified as \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d Although Postmates settled, and thus, we were unsuccessful in challenging the lack of legal protections afforded gig workers, it was certainly not painless nor inexpensive for the company.\nFollowing this brief summary of\u00a0Singer et al v. Postmates, I then turn my attention to the carework site, Care.com. Because Uber often stands in as a (male) synecdoche for the totality of the gig economy (Ticona, Mateescu, Rosenblatt 2018), examining carework offers an important expansion of both the breadth of work that gig workers engage in as well as showing how intersectional inequalities persist even when supposedly \u201cone is their own boss.\u201d Through an analysis of approximately 3500 postings on multiple review sites such as TrustPilot and the Better Business Bureau, a picture of the recurring issues faced by careworkers is revealed. In addition, because it is in the interest of gig companies to hide their unethical practices, these reviews are oftentimes the only way that these grievances can be aired and made publicly visible (Bishop 2019).

Some censorship may be imposed merely to avoid embarrassment (especially to governments).\nSelf-censorship is self-regulation by an individual author or publisher, or by \u2018the industry\u2019. Media industries frequently remind their members that if they do not regulate themselves they will be regulated by the state. Self-censorship on the individual level includes the internal regulation of what one decides to express publically, often attributable to conformism.\nThe panel will explore issues around censorship and self-censorship, looking at recent examples, including the case of Anders Carlson-Wee, who published a poem in The Nation written in Black English (Carlson-Wee is white) and the 22-year-old college student and activist Jos\u00e9 Bello, who was arrested by ICE for reciting a poem critical of the nation\u2019s immigration tactics.\nThe panel includes\npoet and educator Alicia Askenase, who has worked with national and regional poets over many years in New York, South Jersey, and Philadelphia\nHerman Beavers, Professor of English and Africana Studies at Penn\npoet Leonard Gontarek, who coordinates Peace/Works, Poetry In Common, and Philly Poetry Day and hosts The Green Line Reading & Interview Series\nJohn Timpane, freelance theater and fine arts reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer\nLynne Farrington, Senior Curator in the Kislak Center at the Penn Libaries and Project Director for Whitman at 200: Art and Democracy, will serve as the moderator.\nAmong the questions to be considered by the panel are:\nHow do we recognize censorship?Is all censorship bad?Should \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d be absolute or limited, and who decides?Is political correctness a form of censorship?Do we have a right not to be offended?Have you experienced censorship, and how did you respond?The audience will be invited to participate in the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n Featuring\nHerman  Beavers", "endtime": "8:00 PM", "event_index": 1078, "location": "Class of 1978 Orrery Pavilion, Kislak Center, Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center, 6th floor", "owner": "English Department", "speaker": "", "starttime": "6:00 PM", "title": "Censorship & Democracy: From Whitman to the 21st Century", "url": "https://www.english.upenn.edu/events/2019/10/29/censorship-democracy-whitman-21st-century"},

This self-aligning geometry provides a wider range of acceptable error tolerance in relative pose between the two rigid objects, increasing successful docking chances. In a broader context, mechanical alignment properties are also useful for other cases such as foot placement and stability, grasping or manipulation. Previously, computational limitations and costly algorithms prevented high-dimensional analysis. The algorithms presented in this talk will show a reduced computational time and improved resolution for this kind of problem.\nThis dissertation will review multiple methods for evaluating modular robot connector geometries as a case study in determining alignment properties. Several metrics are introduced in terms of the robustness of the alignment to errors across the full dimensional range of possible offsets. Algorithms for quantifying error robustness will be introduced and compared in terms of accuracy, reliability, and computational cost. Connector robustness is then compared across multiple design parameters to find trends in alignment behavior. Methods developed and compared include direct simulation and contact space analysis algorithms (geometric by a \u2018pre-partitioning\u2019 method, and discrete by flooding). Experimental verification for certain subsets is also performed to confirm the results. By evaluating connectors using these algorithms we obtain concrete metric values.

Health is shaped most by the behaviors, events, and circumstances that occur outside of traditional health care contact.\nSocial media offers a window into what people do in their day to day lives external to a healthcare provider visit. The online data reflecting patients' daily activities and social exposures has been termed the social mediome as a corollary to the genome, which is a collection of genetic data from our genes.\nWe discuss our experience collecting social media data from patients in a large health system, connecting those data with electronic health records and using this conception of the social mediome to understand and advance health.\nAbout the Speaker\nDr. Raina M. Merchant is an Associate Vice President at Penn Medicine and an Associate Professor of emergency Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. She has secondary appointments in the Department of Internal Medicine and Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care. She is the Director of the Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health and Co-Director of the Penn National Clinician Scholars Program.\nDr. Merchant attended Yale University for her undergraduate degree, University of Chicago for Medical School, and the University of Pennsylvania for a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholars Program.

In an attempt to focus educational attention on this question, and gather empirical evidence at the same time, we developed the Build it, Break it, Fix it (BIBIFI) security-oriented programming contest. In BIBIFI, teams aim to build specified software that should be correct, efficient, and secure. These goals mimic those of the real world. Security is tested when teams attempt to break other teams\u2019 submissions. Winners are chosen from among the best builders and the best breakers. BIBIFI was designed to be open-ended \u2014 teams can use any language, tool, process, etc. that they like.\nWe ran three 6-week contests involving a total of 156 teams from across the world, and three different programming problems. Most participants had previous development experience and security education. Quantitative analysis from these contests found several interesting trends. For example, the most efficient build-it submissions used C/C++, but submissions coded in a statically-type safe language were 11\u00d7 less likely to have a security flaw than C/C++ submissions. A manual, in-depth qualitative analysis (using iterative open coding) of\u00a0the vulnerabilities in 76 of these projects also revealed interesting trends. For example,\u00a0the analysis found that simple mistakes were least common: only 26% of projects introduced such an error. Conversely, vulnerabilities arising from a misunderstanding of security concepts were significantly more common: 84% of projects introduced at least one such error. Overall, our results have implications for improving secure-programming language choices, API designs, API documentation, vulnerability-finding tools, and security education.\nThis is joint work with James Parker, Andrew Ruef,\u00a0Dan Votipka, Kelsey Fulton, Matthew Hou, Michelle Mazurek, and Dave Levin, all at the University of Maryland", "endtime": "4:00 PM", "event_index": 1103, "location": "Wu and Chen Auditorium (Room 101), Levine Hall,  3330 Walnut Street", "owner": "Computer and Information Science (CIS)", "speaker": "Michael Hicks\nProfessor in the Computer Science Department,  University of Maryland\nBio:\nMichael W.

Although the broader forces that created this society have led to unprecedented material abundance, scholars have maintained that these benefits have come at a significant psychological cost. An important question, then, is how these costs can be minimized. With this in mind, I review a nowextensive program of research showing that consumers derive more satisfaction from experiential purchases (money spent on doing, like on trips, concerts, and meals out) than material purchases (money spent on having, like on high-end clothing, jewelry, and electronic gadgets). I first examine how these hedonic benefits extend to anticipation as well as retrospection, and how this affects preferences for when people prefer to consume these types of purchases. In doing so, I discuss reasons for why the satisfaction from experiential consumption endures in these ways. I then explore further downstream consequences that result from experiential purchases in addition to the increased happiness they tend to provide, focusing on how buying experiences rather than possessions can foster successful social relationships, cultivate feelings of gratitude, and promote prosocial behavior. I conclude by discussing how the overall well-being of society might be advanced by shifting from an overwhelmingly material economy to one that facilitates experiential consumption.", "endtime": "1:20 pm", "event_index": 1104, "location": "JMHH 370", "owner": "Decision Processes Colloquia (Wharton)", "speaker": "Amit Kumar\nAssistant Professor, Marketing\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, McCombs School of Business", "starttime": " 12:00 ", "title": "Looking Forward, Looking Backward: Prospective and Retrospective Benefits of Experiential Investments", "url": "https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/events/dpcolloquia/"},

We develop a novel equilibrium framework that features rich heterogeneity and matching in both markets. In the model, price-taking individuals decide who to marry, and then partners in a household jointly decide how many hours the woman and the man supply to the labor market. Family labor supply decisions, in turn, affect the equilibrium sorting between workers and firms in the labor market and thus hourly wages, which feeds back into marital and household choices. Crucial to this link between marriage and labor market sorting is our assumption that firms/jobs do not only care about matching with the right skill but also value hours worked -something that finds support in the German Socio Economic Panel where we find a positive relationship between hours worked in the labor market and hourly wages. The key insight from our model is that marriage and labor market sorting are linked in an intuitive way by the household's labor choices. The nature of this link depends on whether spouses' hours in home production are complementary or substitutable, which shapes both sorting patterns in each market and labor supply choices. We estimate our model on data from Germany, to quantify how the presence and degree of sorting in both markets affect the gender wage gap and household income inequality. Our preliminary results indicate that primitives associated with more sorting in the marriage market equilibrium feature wives that supply more labor hours and that are better matched in the labor market. As a result, more sorting in the marriage market is associated with a lower gender wage gap. In turn, labor market sorting reinforces the gender wage gap relative to a world with random matching in the labor market. This is because, in equilibrium, individuals supplying more hours (typically men) match with more demanding occupations that pay higher hourly wages.Our paper sheds new light on long-standing and important issues: We explore a novel factor behind the gender gap in labor market outcomes as well as within and between household income inequality, namely, the interaction between equilibrium on the marriage and on the labor market and the associated disparities in labor supply between women and men.", "endtime": "5:30pm", "event_index": 1112, "location": "PCPSE Room 200 \n          United States", "owner": "Department of Economics", "speaker": "Ilse Lindenlaub, Yale University", "starttime": "4:00pm", "title": "Labor Market and Marriage Market Sorting", "url": "https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/events/labor-market-and-marriage-market-sorting"},

These invariants count configurations of pseudoholomorphic disks in a symplectic manifold X with boundary conditions in a Lagrangian submanifold L. However, the construction is rather abstract. Nonetheless, in recent work with Jake Solomon, we find that the superpotential that generates these invariants has many properties that enable calculations. Most notably, the superpotential satisfies the open Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (WDVV) equations. For (X,L)=(CP^n,RP^n), the open WDVV give rise to recursion relations that allow the computation of all invariants. Furthermore, the open WDVV can be reinterpreted as the associativity of a quantum product on relative cohomology H^*(X,L).", "endtime": "05:30 PM", "event_index": 1120, "location": "DRL 4c2", "owner": "Department of Mathematics (Math)", "speaker": "Sara Tukachinsky, IAS", "starttime": "4:30pm", "title": "WDVV and relative quantum cohomology", "url": "https://www.math.upenn.edu/events/wdvv-and-relative-quantum-cohomology"},

On the micron length scale, inertial forces are weak and conventional motor designs involving, e.g., pistons or flywheels cease to function. Biological motors work by a different principle and use catalysis to convert chemical to mechanical energy on the nanometer length scale.\nTogether with Ayusman Sen and other colleagues at Penn State we have explored the concept of using catalysis to power synthetic nano- and microswimmers. Bi- and trimetallic microwires are catalytically self-propelled in fuel-containing solutions at speeds that are comparable to those of flagellar bacteria. Detailed studies of the mechanism of chemically-driven motion on the micron length scale show that the propulsion of bimetallic swimmers derives from locally generated electric fields. The same principle can be used pump fluids using inorganic or enzymatic catalysts. Despite the difference in propulsion mechanisms, catalytic swimmers are subject to the same external forces as natural microswimmers such as bacteria. Therefore they follow the same scaling laws and exhibit similar emergent behavior (e.g., magnetotaxis, chemotaxis, schooling, and predator-prey behavior). Interestingly, we find that a broad range of molecular catalysts (such as enzymes and polymerization catalysts) also move, transfer momentum to their surroundings, and are subject to chemotactic forces while carrying out their catalytic reactions.\nIn collaboration with Mauricio Hoyos at ESPCI (Paris) we have found that asymmetric nanoparticles also undergo autonomous motion and a range of interesting collective behaviors in fluids when they are excited by low power ultrasound. The acoustic propulsion mechanism, particularly when combined with magnetic, chemical, or photochemical propulsion for steering and assembly, is potentially useful for diagnostic and biomedical applications because it is salt-tolerant and does not involve toxic chemical fuels.", "starttime": "10:45 AM", "title": "MSE Seminar: \u201cHow Do You Make a Micro-Robot?\u201d", "url": "https://events.seas.upenn.edu/event/mse-seminar-how-do-you-make-a-micro-robot/"},

Davis II, Assistant Professor of Architectural History\u00a0and Criticism, University at Buffalo\nThis creative work examines the modern architectural principles elaborated by African American writers during the postwar period. It uses architectural drawings and models to visualize the utopian implications established by the writings of the novelist Paule Marshall (1929- ), the poet June Jordan (1936-2002), the dramatist Amiri Baraka (1934-2014), and the philosopher Angela Davis (1944- ). While most of these writers never received formal training in architecture, they each found ways of radically incorporating the language and principles of architectural modernism into their reinterpretation of poor, black, urban spaces that moved beyond mere description.* Davis argues that their rhetorical manipulations of space operate on the same level as utopian architectural schemes: both mediums liberate the architect\u2019s imagination by relaying a set of physical strategies for reforming the built environment.

He studied architecture intermittently at the then Regent Street Polytechnic School of Architecture (now the University of Westminster) between the years 1953 and 1972; a somewhat lengthy student career. A project he designed during his fourth year at the Polytechnic found its way, owing to a curious set of circumstances, into an exhibition at MoMA New York entitled \"Visionary Architecture\" in 1960. The following year his thesis project for an entertainments center in the middle of London was repeatedly failed at the Poly; nevertheless it became widely published, and was featured in November 2009 at the \"First Projects\" exhibition at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London.\nIn 1961, he was invited by Sir Peter Cook to be part of an assortment of young architects who referred to themselves as the Archigram group, publishing a magazine with the same title. The group rebelled against what it saw as the failure of the architectural establishment in Britain to produce buildings reflecting the dynamic changes, both technological and social, the country was then undergoing. For the last 26 years a large exhibition of the group\u2019s work has been touring world capitals; and in 2006 Archigram was awarded the Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects.\nWebb emigrated to the USA in 1965. He sees his raison d'etre as deriving from the drawings he has produced over the years: among these being the Temple Island Study, which resulted in an eponymously titled book published by the AA in 1987; and the Drive-in House series. A monograph entitled Two Journeys was published in 2018.. His writing has appeared many times in Architectural Design magazine, Daidalos, and in the Journal of Architectural Education.\nHe has had one man shows at the Cooper Union, Columbia University, the Storefront Gallery in NY, the Architecture League in NY, the University of Manitoba at Winnipeg, and the Art Net Gallery in London. He was a fellow at the CCA in Montreal in 2010 and 2011 and has been honored with grants from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York Foundation for the Arts, and the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts.\nHe has taught design studios and drawing at Virginia Tech, the Rhode Island School of Design, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Pratt Institute and the Cooper Union, where he occupied the Charles Gwathmey chair.\nIn memory of Barney Cunningham, this lecture will honor his high standards and commitment to building construction, technology, professional practice and ethics.

In a series of projects, my coauthors and I examine how individuals summarize group behavior in order to learn the descriptive and prescriptive norms of the group. First, we consider how individuals summarize group behavior when the group contains an outlier, one member who behaves differently than others. We find that individuals tend to overweight the behavior of outliers but that this effect is curvilinear with more extreme outliers being discounted, particularly in inferences of the prescriptive norm. Second, we consider how individuals infer the descriptive norm as a function of the hierarchical rank of those they observe. We find that individuals tend to give greater weight to the behavior of lower ranking individuals in comparison to higher ranking individuals.

However, to fit such interaction models on typical data sets in biology and other fields can often require solving enormous variable selection problems with billions of interactions. The scale of such problems demands methods that are computationally cheap (both in time and memory) yet still have sound statistical properties. Motivated by these large-scale problem sizes, we adopt a very simple guiding principle: One should prefer a main effect over an interaction if all else is equal. This \u201creluctance\u201d to interactions, while reminiscent of the hierarchy principle for interactions, is much less restrictive. We design a computationally efficient method built upon this principle and provide theoretical results indicating favorable statistical properties. Empirical results show dramatic computational improvement without sacrificing statistical properties. For example, the proposed method can solve a problem with 10 billion interactions with 5-fold cross-validation in under 7 hours on a single CPU.

We conceptualize trashtalking as incivility that is expressed in competition. In this research seminar, we explore the dysfunction and function of trash-talking. In every trash-talking exchange, there is a trashtalker, a target, and typically an audience. To understand the dysfunction of trash-talking, we examine the effect of trash-talking on the target. We demonstrate that participants in a competition who are targets of trash-talking are more likely to outperform participants who face the same economic incentives, but are targets of neutral communication. Furthermore, we find that perceptions of rivalry mediate the relationship between trash-talking and effort-based performance. To explore the function of trash-talking, we consider the effect of trash-talking on an audience of in-group members. We find that trash-talking about an out-group promotes prosocial behavior, relative to neutral communication. In addition, group identification mediates the relationship between trash-talking and prosocial behavior. Taken together, our findings highlight how trash-talking is a common workplace behavior that can motivate both constructive and destructive behavior.", "endtime": "1:20 pm", "event_index": 1180, "location": "JMHH 370", "owner": "Decision Processes Colloquia (Wharton)", "speaker": "Jeremy Yip\nAssistant Professor, Management\u00a0\nGeorgetown University, McDonough School of Business", "starttime": " 12:00 ", "title": "Trash-talking: The Dysfunction and Function of Incivility", "url": "https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/events/dpcolloquia/"},

We switch perspective and describe such series through an automaton, a kind of memory-less Turing machine described by a finite directed labelled graph. Combining some Galois theory with lucky guessing and and algorithmic version of a theorem of Christol (or a more recent version of Bridy and Speyer), we are able to provide an explicit automaton-theoretic description of (a) representatives up to conjugation for all series of order 4 with break sequence (1,m) for m<10; (b) a series of order 8 with minimal break sequence; and (c) an embedding of the Klein Four Group into the Nottingham group at 2.

It implies that technological change promotes employment when initial productivity is low so that firms and workers are not very selective in matching, whereas it hampers employment when initial productivity is high enough to make firms and workers sufficiently selective.

Before joining the Faculty at the Weitzman School, she was the Frieda L. Miller Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced study at Harvard University.\nToday Austrian architect Margarete Sch\u00fctte-Lihotzky (1897-2000) is widely recognized as one of the pioneering female figures in modern design, who worked in Vienna, Frankfurt, the Soviet Union, and Turkey in the 1920s and 1930s. Yet, these decades of professional work were marked by a drastic break between 1940 and 1945, when Sch\u00fctte-Lihotzky was interned for her participation in the Communist resistance against by the Nazi regime. Her recollections from the years of internment became the subject of the 1984 German-language book Erinnerungen aus dem Widerstand (Memories of the Resistance), currently edited by Hochh\u00e4usl and translated by Raphael Koenig and Christianna Bonnin.\nThe lecture \u201cMemories of the Resistance\u201d explores Sch\u00fctte-Lihotzky\u2019s book as a critical historical document that exemplifies the spatialization of organized dissent in the 1940s. It also provides a glimpse into resistance as lived practice and how it became activated by human solidarity and collective action. Finally, the lecture comments on why Sch\u00fctte-Lihotzky\u2019s activism led to the ostracization of the important architect in postwar Austria, where her struggle for spaces of collective memorialization remains largely forgotten until today. The talk will include excerpted readings from the English language book, which is currently edited and translated by Sophie Hochh\u00e4usl, Raphael Koenig, and Christianna Bonin.\nHochh\u00e4usl\u2019s scholarly work centers on modern architecture and urban culture in Austria, Germany, and the United States,\u00a0with a focus on the history of social movements, environmental history, and women\u2019s and gender studies. Currently, she is working on two forthcoming book projects. The monograph\u00a0Housing Cooperative: Politics and Architecture in Vienna, 1904-1934, which\u00a0elucidates the role of cooperatives in shaping architectural debates in interwar Vienna. The interdisciplinary history and translation project\u00a0Memories of the Resistance: Women, War, and the Forgotten Work of Margarete Sch\u00fctte-Lihotzky, 1938-1989, illuminates the Austrian architect\u2019s participation in the Communist resistance against the Nazi regime.\nIn the past Hochh\u00e4usl has received a Carter Manny Award and the Bruno Zevi Award.

His topic: Falling Out of Love with Science: Why Congress Doesn't Fund Medical Innovation. Attendees heard about all the many innovations we use every day which were only made possible through generous federal funding for scientific research, from GPS technology to the iPhone screens. Mr. Yager also discussed the divide between many American voters and the scientists toiling away in their labs, as well as how to bridge the gap between the two seemingly very different worlds. Spoiler alert: the key is seeing the humanity in all people and taking time to understand each person's circumstances before casting aspersions on their opinions of things that might matter greatly to YOU but not to them. Mr. Yager concluded by issuing a challenge to the audience: become pen pals with your legislators. Email them, write them, go to their town halls and campaign events and bother them about the issues that matter to you, because if you don't, you will quickly learn the truth of what Senator Mike Enzi said: \"If you're not at the table, you're on the menu.\"", "endtime": "01:00 PM", "event_index": 1221, "location": "Biomedical Research Building II/III, Gaulton Auditorium", "owner": "Penn Science Policy & Diplomacy Group (PSPDG)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "title": "Milan Yager speaking event: Falling Out of Love with Science-- Why Congress Doesn't Fund Medical Innovation", "url": "https://pennsciencepolicy.squarespace.com/events/2018/11/29/milan-yager-speaking-event-falling-out-of-love-with-science-why-congress-doesnt-fund-medical-innovation"},

Why are some vulnerable communities able to\u00a0demand and secure development from the state while others fail?\u00a0Drawing on more than two years of fieldwork in the north Indian\u00a0cities of Bhopal and Jaipur, Demanding Development accounts for the uneven success of India\u2019s slum residents in securing local public goods\u00a0and services from the state. Auerbach\u2019s theory centers on the political organization of\u00a0slum settlements and the informal slum leaders who spearhead resident\u00a0efforts to make claims on the state\u2014in particular, those slum leaders\u00a0who are party workers.

Prior to joining Columbia University, he was a Fellow at the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance at Princeton University. He earned his Ph.D. from Yale University.About the Lecture:Conventional wisdom about colonialism suggests that imperial trading relations were a one-way street: trade policy forced colonies to export raw materials to the metropole and, in turn, purchase large quantities of manufactured goods from the empire\u2019s industrial centers, thus hamstringing local industries. Professor Gaikwad argues that this narrative overlooks a critical feature of colonial history following the First World War, namely the devolution of limited representation to key colonies such as India. Using an original dataset of all product-level import tariffs in British India, 1921-49, as well as archival records of local legislative debates and confidential correspondence, he attempts to show that incipient democracy eroded Britain\u2019s ability to shape India\u2019s tariff policy to suit British needs. His findings demonstrate that the introduction of a limited franchise shifted the balance of power in trade policy, illustrating how electoral autonomy reduced the rapacity of colonial power.[Event Flyer]", "endtime": "", "event_index": 1247, "location": "", "owner": "Center for the Advanced Study of India", "speaker": "", "starttime": "", "title": "The Interests of India Demand Protection: Democratization and Trade Policy Under Empire", "url": "https://casi.ssc.upenn.edu/events/nikhargaikwad"},

As a career civil servant, he worked in various positions in the state government of Andhra Pradesh and in the federal government of India. He was a Lead Economist in the World Bank (1999 - 2004).Dr. Subbarao studied at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur and later at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur. He went to Graduate School at Ohio State University where he got an MS in Economics and later was a Humphrey Fellow at MIT studying Public Finance. He got his Ph.D. from Andhra University.Dr. Subbarao began as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India just a week before the global financial crisis erupted in full in mid-September 2008, and he led the effort to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the Indian economy and to institute economic and financial sector reforms reflecting the lessons of the crisis.In his capacity first as Finance Secretary and later as Governor, RBI, Dr. Subbarao was alternate Governor for India on the Governing Boards of the World Bank and the IMF. He participated actively in the G 20 meetings, the meetings of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (of the IMF), bi-monthly meetings of Governors at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, the Asian Consultative Committee of central bank Governors, and a host of other international committees and conferences where his views were respected for the emerging market perspective he brought to bear on the discussions.About the Lecture:India grew at a rapid clip during Prime Minister Modi\u2019s first term (2014-19), occasionally gaining bragging rights as the fastest growing large economy in the world.

We develop a particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion model based on the Convergent Reaction-Diffusion Master Equation to study the combined diffusion of individual receptors within the cell membrane, and chemical reactions between proteins bound to receptor tails. The model suggests a switch-like behavior in the dependence of the fraction of activated receptors on both receptor diffusivity, and on the molecular reach at which two receptor tails can interact.

These sites can serve as regulators of receptor activation when phosphorylated or dephosphorylated, while also serving as docking sites for cytosolic enzymes. Interactions between receptors then involve the in-membrane diffusion of the receptor proteins, and reactions between proteins tethered to the receptors' tails (and hence diffusing within the three-dimensional cytosolic space near the membrane). We develop a particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion model based on the Convergent Reaction-Diffusion Master Equation to study the combined diffusion of individual receptors within the cell membrane, and chemical reactions between proteins bound to receptor tails. The model suggests a switch-like behavior in the dependence of the fraction of activated receptors on both receptor diffusivity, and on the molecular reach at which two receptor tails can interact. A simplified, analytically solvable model is developed to approximate the more complicated multi-particle system, and used to illustrate how the switch-like behavior arises.", "endtime": "5:00pm", "event_index": 1266, "location": "", "owner": "Department of Physics and Astronomy", "speaker": "Samuel Isaacson (Boston University)", "starttime": "4:00pm", "title": "Mathematical Biology seminar: \"Control of membrane-bound tethered signaling reactions\"", "url": "https://www.physics.upenn.edu/events/mathematical-biology-seminar-control-membrane-bound-tethered-signaling-reactions"},

Math/physical communities are much less aware that there are numerous example of fascinating many-body problems of classical mechanics arising in live cells at drastically different scales: instead of years and millions of kilometers, in the cell we deal with minutes and microns. Another big difference is: rather than Newtonian mechanics in empty space, when acceleration is proportional to force, in the cells filled with viscous cytoplasm, we deal with Aristotelian mechanics, in which velocity is proportional to force. Yet another difference is a great diversity of complex inter-body forces in the cell, compared to pleasingly simple gravitational force of celestial mechanics. Because of this diversity, in cell biology we often need to solve the ill-posed inverse problem \u2013 reverse-engineering forces from the observed patterns and movements \u2013 contrasted with the well-posed direct problem of predicting patterns and movements from known forces.\nI will discuss two many-body problems of cell biology \u2013 assembly of mitotic spindle from two centrosomes and tens of chromosomes, and nuclei positioning in multi-nucleated muscle cells.

When using such data, a firm wants to select the interval of analysis (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly) that provides an estimate of the effectiveness of their marketing mix with minimum bias and variance. (We refer to this granularity as the minimum discrepancy (\u201cMD\u201d) granularity.) However, in most empirical studies, the MD granularity is unknown. While extant literature has shown that empirical results depend on the chosen level of the granularity, it has not proposed a structured way to select it. Our research fills this gap by proposing a granularity \u201cselection tool.\u201d We first propose the desired properties a tool should have and then prove that the power likelihood, which raises each standard likelihood term to latent weights, satisfies these properties under certain boundary conditions. An extensive set of simulations shows that the power likelihood has high statistical accuracy in selecting the MD granularity, and more effectively than other approaches. Finally, we apply our framework to a Nielsen store-level scanner data set, and compare how selecting the granularity with the power likelihood and extant methods affect the empirical results and optimal marketing decisions. This is joint work with Mingyung Kim and Raghuram Iyengar.

Although the broader forces that created this society have led to unprecedented material abundance, scholars have maintained that these benefits have come at a significant psychological cost. An important question, then, is how these costs can be minimized. With this in mind, I review a nowextensive program of research showing that consumers derive more satisfaction from experiential purchases (money spent on doing, like on trips, concerts, and meals out) than material purchases (money spent on having, like on high-end clothing, jewelry, and electronic gadgets). I first examine how these hedonic benefits extend to anticipation as well as retrospection, and how this affects preferences for when people prefer to consume these types of purchases. In doing so, I discuss reasons for why the satisfaction from experiential consumption endures in these ways. I then explore further downstream consequences that result from experiential purchases in addition to the increased happiness they tend to provide, focusing on how buying experiences rather than possessions can foster successful social relationships, cultivate feelings of gratitude, and promote prosocial behavior. I conclude by discussing how the overall well-being of society might be advanced by shifting from an overwhelmingly material economy to one that facilitates experiential consumption.\n+ Google Calendar+ iCal Export", "endtime": "1:20 PM", "event_index": 1351, "location": "F55 Huntsman Hall", "owner": "Wharton Neuroscience Initiative", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "title": "Amit Kumar: Looking Forward, Looking Backward: Prospective and Retrospective Benefits of Experiential Investments", "url": "https://neuro.wharton.upenn.edu/event/amit-kumar-looking-forward-looking-backward-prospective-and-retrospective-benefits-of-experiential-investments/"},

We conceptualize trashtalking as incivility that is expressed in competition. In this research seminar, we explore the dysfunction and function of trash-talking. In every trash-talking exchange, there is a trashtalker, a target, and typically an audience. To understand the dysfunction of trash-talking, we examine the effect of trash-talking on the target. We demonstrate that participants in a competition who are targets of trash-talking are more likely to outperform participants who face the same economic incentives, but are targets of neutral communication. Furthermore, we find that perceptions of rivalry mediate the relationship between trash-talking and effort-based performance. To explore the function of trash-talking, we consider the effect of trash-talking on an audience of in-group members. We find that trash-talking about an out-group promotes prosocial behavior, relative to neutral communication. In addition, group identification mediates the relationship between trash-talking and prosocial behavior. Taken together, our findings highlight how trash-talking is a common workplace behavior that can motivate both constructive and destructive behavior.\n+ Google Calendar+ iCal Export", "endtime": "1:20 PM", "event_index": 1352, "location": "F55 Huntsman Hall", "owner": "Wharton Neuroscience Initiative", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "title": "Jeremy Yip: Trash-talking: The Dysfunction and Function of Incivility", "url": "https://neuro.wharton.upenn.edu/event/jeremy-yip-trash-talking-the-dysfunction-and-function-of-incivility/"},

The classic approach of assuming that people are rational agents has the advantage of making it possible to derive generalizable models for any new circumstance, but has been shown to give a poor characterization of actual human behavior. By contrast, the \u201cheuristics and biases\u201d perspective that has replaced it provides explanations for the ways in which people deviate from rationality, but doesn\u2019t give us an overarching framework that we can use to make predictions about how people will act in new situations. In this talk I will present a framework that reconciles these two perspectives, based on the idea of \u201cresource rationality\u201d \u2014 that human decision-making is impaired by limited cognitive resources, but that people nonetheless make rational use of the resources that are available to them. This framework can be used to capture some classic results from the heuristics and biases literature and provides a way to automatically derive new models of behavior with similar generality to classic approaches to rationality.\n+ Google Calendar+ iCal Export", "endtime": "1:20 PM", "event_index": 1353, "location": "F55 Huntsman Hall", "owner": "Wharton Neuroscience Initiative", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "title": "Tom Griffiths: Resource-Rational Models of Decision-Making", "url": "https://neuro.wharton.upenn.edu/event/tom-griffiths-resource-rational-models-of-decision-making/"},

Yet there are opportunities to connect language learning and teaching with the lives and experiences of local language communities and organizations. As community-based service learning gains traction throughout the university curriculum, language educators are asking: How do I design, integrate and      lead community-based service learning initiatives at my institution? How can I identify and ensure      that these initiatives are responsive to the needs and desires of both      language learners and community members? What kinds of pedagogical      activities can I incorporate into my instructional design to support both      my students\u2019 language development and their abilities to think critically      and conscientiously about the community-based work they are participating      in? This symposium aims to address these questions on as well as implications for integrating community-based service learning into the language classroom. Theoretical and practical models will frame discussions developing modules and courses in your own classrooms and programs. In the end, participants will have clear takeaways of how to engage local language communities in ethical and pedagogically sound ways.

Baldwin, an American novelist, playwright, and activist, explored intricacies of racial, sexual, and class distinctions in Western societies. His essay,\u00a0A Report from Occupied Territory, focuses on the impact of segregated education, joblessness and police brutality in marginalized communities. Although written several decades ago, Baldwin\u2019s observations are still relevant and continue to resonate. This initiative represents one of several activities that have been established as part of HEARD (Hub for Equity, Anti-Oppression, Research, and Development). A goal of this reading group is to discuss various readings on topics that interrogate structures of power and the re/production of forms of oppression related to race, religion, gender, class, legal status, citizenship, etc., and to consider how these issues impact our work here at GSE. It is our hope that this reading group will provide opportunities for us to learn from each other as we engage in rich conversations on these topics. This year, we will be featuring essays, articles, brief videos, and short stories written by authors who have focused on various types of oppression.

Investments by large companies such as Apple, Facebook, and Google are helping to drive growth in the field. Yet, haptic technology is complex and specialized, with advancements resulting from only a small group of experts and lab-based studies that do not scale to the diverse needs and preferences of users. My goal is to create a future where anyone can understand, access, and adapt touch technology for their needs. In this talk, I present my research in supporting three groups of future haptics creators: 1) end users, 2) interaction designers, and 3) haptics experts. I describe their mental models for haptics, demonstrate collections and tools that accumulate years of expert knowledge for novices, and present methods for running large-scale studies in haptics. Finally, I discuss the remaining steps toward a future where effective and fun virtual touch experiences are designed, tailored, and embraced by all.", "endtime": "1:00pm", "event_index": 1398, "location": "3330 Walnut StreetLevine 307", "owner": "General Robotics, Automation, Sensing & Perception laboratory (GRASP)", "speaker": " Hasti Seifi, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, \"Democratizing Haptics\"", "starttime": "12:00pm", "title": "GRASP Special Seminar: Hasti Seifi, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, \"Democratizing Haptics\"", "url": "https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/events/hasti-seifi"},

That was the question posed by the curators, artists, scholars, and students who comprise the Philadelphia-based public art and history studio Monument Lab. And in 2017, along with Mural Arts Philadelphia, they produced and organized a groundbreaking, city-wide exhibition of temporary, site-specific works that engaged directly with the community. The installations, by a cohort of diverse artists considering issues of identity, appeared in iconic public squares and neighborhood parks with research and learning labs and prototype monuments.\nMonument Lab is a compendium of the exhibition and a critical reflection of the proceedings, including contributions from interlocutors and collaborators. The exhibition and this handbook were designed to generate new ways of thinking about monuments and public art as well as to find new, critical perspectives to reflect on the monuments we have inherited and to imagine those we have yet to build. Monument Lab energizes a civic dialogue about public art and history around what it means to be a Philadelphian.\nArtists: Tania Bruguera, Mel Chin, Kara Crombie, Tyree Guyton, Hans Haacke, David Hartt, Sharon Hayes, King Britt and Joshua Mays, Klip Collective, Duane Linklater, Emeka Ogboh, Karyn Olivier, Michelle Angela Ortiz, Kaitlin Pomerantz, RAIR, Alexander Rosenberg, Jamel Shabazz, Hank Willis Thomas, Shira Walinsky and Southeast by Southeast, and Marisa Williamson\nContributors: Alexander Alberro, Alliyah Allen, Laurie Allen, Andrew Friedman, Justin Geller, Kristen Giannantonio, Jane Golden, Aviva Kapust, Fariah Khan, Homay King, Stephanie Mach, Trapeta B.

While quantum computers with few dozens of qubits have been demonstrated, these machines suffer from high rate of gate errors. Such machines are operated in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) mode of computing where the output of the machine can be erroneous. In this talk, I will discuss some of our recent work that aims to improve the reliability of NISQ computers by developing software techniques to mitigate the hardware errors. Our first= work (ASPLOS 2019) exploits the variability in the error rates of qubits to steer more operations towards qubits with lower error rates and avoid qubits that are error-prone. Our second work (MICRO 2019) looks at executing different versions of the programs each crafted to cause diverse mistakes so that the machine becomes less vulnerable to correlated errors. Our third work (MICRO 2019) looks at exploiting the state-dependent bias in measurement errors (state 1 is more error prone than state 0) and dynamically flips the state of the qubit to perform the measurement in the stronger state. We perform our evaluations on real quantum machines from IBM and demonstrate significant improvement in the overall system reliability.

During the Umbrella Movement in 2014, Nathan was one of the five representatives who took part in the dialogue with government, debating political reform. Upholding non-violent civic actions, Law, Joshua Wong and other student leaders founded Demosist\u014d in 2016, and also co-founded Network of Young Democratic Asians (NOYDA), aiming at promoting exchanges among social activists in other East Asian countries.In the recent Hong Kong Legislative Council elections, Law was elected with 50,818 votes in the Hong Kong Island constituency and became youngest Legislative Councilor in history. However, his seat was overturned in July 2017 following Beijing's constitutional reinterpretation despite international criticism. Law was later jailed for his participation in the Umbrella Movement. The persecution sparked global concern over Beijing's crackdown on human rights and democratic movement in Hong Kong. In 2018, Law and his fellow student activists Joshua Wong and Alex Chow were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by US congressmen and British members of Parliament.

  {"date": "December 4", "date_dt": "04-12-2019", "description": "Abstract: Measurement error and missing data are two phenomena which prevent researchers from observing essential quantities in their studies. Measurement error occurs when data are subject to variability which masks an underlying value. Recognition of measurement error is essential to preventing bias in an analysis, and methods to handle it have been well-developed in recent years. However, in time-to-event analyses, competing risks is another important consideration which can invalidate study results if not properly accounted for. Current methods to accommodate competing risks do not account for measurement error, and, as a result, incur a large amount of bias when using covariates measured with error. We first propose a novel method which combines the intuition of the subdistribution model for competing risks with risk set regression calibration, which corrects for measurement error in Cox regression by recalibrating at each failure time. We show through simulations that the proposed estimator removes bias that occurs when measurement error is ignored. The second part of this dissertation addresses missing outcome data in longitudinal models. We propose a novel method to account for missing longitudinal outcome data in the situation where some patients have no recorded outcomes. We accomplish this through use of an auxiliary outcome available for all patients, and we avoid the pitfall of misspecification by estimating its relationship with the true outcome data nonparametrically. We show that this method is more efficient than conventional methods and robust to misspecification. For both proposed methods, we develop asymptotic theory and provide consistent variance estimates. We also apply both proposed methods to neurodegenerative disease data. Finally, we introduce an R package to implement the first proposed method and make it widely available for regular use.\u00a0\n\n\nDissertation Advisor: Sharon Xie, PhD\u00a0\n\n\nCommittee Chair: Warren Bilker, PhD\u00a0\n\n\nCommittee: Murray Grossman, MD, EdD, Justine Shults, PhD, Lauren Massimo, PhD, CRNP", "endtime": " 11:00am", "event_index": 1488, "location": "Rubenstein Auditorium, Smilow Center for Translational Research, 3400 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "10:00am ", "title": "Biostatistics Dissertation Defense - Carrie Caswell", "url": "http://events.med.upenn.edu/cceb/#!view/event/event_id/713289"},

The properties of convolutional filters in a trained deep network directly affect the quality of the data representation being learned. In this talk, we introduce a framework of decomposing convolutional filters over a truncated set of bases to reduce the model and computational complexity of deep CNNs with automatically imposed filter regularity. This includes efficient group equivariant convolutional layers, which explicitly encode rotation and scaling group actions in image data with provable representation stability, by adopting a joint basis decomposition over space and group geometry simultaneously. When allowing the light-weighted basis layer to be adapted to varying modals and enforcing the coefficient layer to be shared across environments, the filter decomposed CNN provides a new way of invariant feature learning, where we introduce applications in domain adaptation and conditional generative networks in computer vision.

We do so by constructing an abstract formal model, and a more complex agent-based model. In the broader context of multiparty competitive games (which are closely related to civil wars), we make several critical assumptions regarding the motivations for coalition formation (and dis-integration) and view coalitions as an outcome of rational, utilitarian choices made by the agents. Accordingly, we investigate two specific types of such problems. The first problem is the existence and characteristics of the\u00a0stable states.\u00a0We investigate when such stable states are viable, and potential path dependency on initial states. The second problem is the influence of certain changes in agent properties (objective position in Euclidean space, normalized power size, etc.) on the dynamics of coalition formations. In particular, we are interested in learning how such characteristics influence the evolution surrounding\u00a0stable states.\nWe approach the problems using two set of methods. First, we present a formal, mathematical model inspired by theories from non-cooperative games and the legislative coalition formations, to explore the existence and characteristics of the\u00a0stable states. Later, we develop an agent-based counterpart that extends the formal model. We leverage computational modeling to explore the system dynamics at scale. The findings on the characteristics of coalition dynamics model are further validated through both statistical analysis and empirical case studies, where we also compare the model predictions with those from alternative coalition theories from relevant fields.\nCommittee Members:\nProf. Tony E.

Our approach is grounded on the integration of concepts and tools from graph theory, control theory, optimization, and statistics. In particular, we develop methodologies that can be applied to challenging, high-dimensional problems where only partial or summarized information about the structure and function of a complex system is available. We validate our methods across different application domains, most remarkably with large-scale neuroimaging datasets that follow state-of-the-art acquisition techniques and span multiple individuals and experimental paradigms.\nStructurally, the contributions of this thesis have been divided in three parts. In the first part, we address the topic of inference and analysis of complex networks. In particular, we establish data-driven models and algorithms that approximate measures of functional connectivity, derived from a system\u2019s potentially complex dynamics, as a matrix mapping based on structural connectivity information. Using tools from spectral graph theory, we propose a mapping technique that is able to systematically account for the role of indirect structural walks in the generation of functional associations. We then apply our method to obtain accurate structural-to-functional connectivity mappings for brain networks derived from functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and diffusion imaging measurements, and perform a series of analyses of the generated mappings in terms of their spectral characteristics.\nIn the second part, we devote our attention to the problem of identification of system dynamics. First, we generate data-driven dynamic models that capture the influence of cognitive inputs on brain signals that are observed through fMRI measurements. More specifically, we extend subspace system identification methods to create large-scale, linear time-invariant representations for both single and multiple-individual configurations of a motor task-fMRI experiment, and apply control-theoretic tools to analyze the dynamical characteristics of the resulting models. Subsequently, to abate some general limitations of linear time-invariant models, we propose three novel system identification approaches. Specifically, we (i) enable the identification of state-space linear time-varying models through a generalized expectation maximization method, (ii) perform the estimation of linear parameter-varying models having a latent parameter space via Bayesian variational inference, and (iii) implement blind subspace identification using Riemannian optimization.\nIn the last part of the thesis, we focus on the topic of network design for dynamic performance. More specifically, we address the problem of finding edge weights of a linear networked dynamical system such that certain bounds on its controllability metrics are satisfied. In particular, we consider the worst-case (i.e., minimum eigenvalue of the controllability Gramian) and average-case (i.e., trace of the inverse controllability Gramian) metrics. Algorithmically, we provide a principled convex relaxation approach that exhibits guaranteed convergence and known global optimal value. Our methodology includes the possibility to consider cost functions over the edge weights which can be used, for example, to promote solutions with higher sparsity in the required edge modifications. Finally, we verify our results with numerical simulations over many random network realizations, and with multi-agent and power system topologies.\nAdvisor:\nVictor M.

We look forward to seeing many of you at this talk!\n\u00a0\n*****\nWhen Richard Wagner created a lowered orchestra pit at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in the 1870s he famously described the decision in terms of concealment; an attempt to hide the means of sound production. In view of the modifications made to numerous opera houses in the decades that followed to create similar orchestra pits, scholars have tended to assume that the Festspielhaus was both the stimulus and model for such spaces. If this tends to flatten out important variations in architectural design between theaters, it also narrates the introduction of orchestra pits from the perspective of audience members alone. While lowered orchestral platforms might have functioned as so-called \u201cmystical chasms\u201d from which sound floated upwards towards awed spectators, these also had a crucial role in the creation of enclosed, protected spaces for musicians.\nThe 1907 construction of the so-called \u201cgolfo mistico\u201d at the preeminent Teatro alla Scala in Milan, under the supervision of Arturo Toscanini, was to a considerable extent an experiment in the creation of a more professional atmosphere than performance at audience level allowed. However much the term golfo mistico betrays a Romantic conception of the space, it was not, I argue, coincidental that the pit was constructed in the same moment that trade unions for musicians were establishing themselves. Meanwhile, musicians were also becoming familiar with other sorts of enclosures calibrated to control acoustics and eliminate distractions, in the form of the earliest sound studios. Placing La Scala\u2019s golfo mistico in the context of these dual developments in the Italian music industry at the time, I reveal the extent of the orchestra pit\u2019s entanglements in a musical landscape which increasingly placed musicians at one remove from their audiences; in tandem, I offer a new framework in which to make sense of the new (and enduring) fashion for this architectural innovation.", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_index": 1534, "location": "Music Building, Lerner Center 101", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "Prof. Laura Protano-Biggs", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "title": "POSTPONED to Nov. 26: Laura Protano-Biggs on the Teatro alla Scala in Milan (Music Building)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2019/11/postponed-nov-26-laura-protano-biggs-teatro-alla-scala-milan-music-building"},

A stream of photons is typically topologically trivial, nevertheless, its full-vector nature intrinsically endows light with full capability of creating and carrying unique symmetry and topology, especially non-Hermitian symmetries that cannot be easily implemented in condensed matter. Explorations of symmetry and topology on a photonic platform not only deepen our understanding of fundamental physics, but also enable novel material properties to facilitate technological breakthroughs for photonic applications. In this seminar, I will present our recent efforts on investigating the complex optical potentials with the non-Hermitian parity-time symmetry for the next generation of optical communication and information technology. We demonstrated an orbital angular momentum (OAM) microlaser that structures and twists the lasing radiation at the microscale, which can provide an additional OAM-based information dimension to meet the growing demand for information capacity. By strategically interfacing non-Hermitian photonic materials and topological physics, we realized the dynamic control of robust topological transmission links of light inside the bulk of a photonic topological insulator, routing optical signals in a highly flexible and scalable manner.", "endtime": "11:45 AM", "event_index": 1538, "location": "Auditorium, LRSM Building,  3231 Walnut Street", "owner": "Materials Science and Engineering (MSE)", "speaker": "Liang Feng\nAssistant Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania\nLiang Feng is an Assistant Professor of Materials Science & Engineering at University of Pennsylvania.

Under a DC electric field, the resistance of YSZ and Fe-doped strontium titanate (Fe-STO) degrades in an indistinguishable way. This is surprising because, unlike YSZ, Fe-STO is a p-type semiconductor, so they cannot possibly degrade by the same mechanism. For decades, it is known that the degradation of perovskite titanates is caused by the migration of oxygen vacancies towards the cathode, where they are blocked, and thus pile up, which changes the region to n-type. In contrast, through highly accelerated in situ lifetime tests, we determined, for the first time, that the DC voltage induces in YSZ a metal-insulator transition that propagates from the cathode to the anode, which lowers the resistance by orders of magnitude. In situ studies have further provided direct observations and mechanisms of resistance switching of both YSZ and Fe-STO. This is also of great importance as they relate to another technologically relevant device: resistance random access memory (ReRAM), which is currently explored for neuromorphic computing.", "endtime": "11:45 AM", "event_index": 1539, "location": "Auditorium, LRSM Building,  3231 Walnut Street", "owner": "Materials Science and Engineering (MSE)", "speaker": "Ana Alvarez\nPh.D. Candidate, I-Wei Chen Group, University of Pennsylvania", "starttime": "10:45 AM", "title": "MSE Seminar: \u201cIn-Situ Resistance Degradation & Switching of Bulk Fe-doped SrTiO3 and Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia\u201d", "url": "https://events.seas.upenn.edu/event/mse-seminar-in-situ-resistance-degradation-switching-of-bulk-fe-doped-srtio3-and-yttria-stabilized-zirconia/"},

Operating in the shadows, fixers' contributions to journalism are largely hidden from us, yet they underpin the entire international news industry: almost every international news story we read today could not be produced without a fixer. Indeed, without fixers' on-the-ground skill and intimate knowledge of a territory, journalists would struggle to document stories unfolding in countries outside their own. Despite this, however, fixers remain one of the most under-protected and undervalued groups contributing to the production of news. Targeted by militant groups and governments, even by their neighbors, they must often engage in a precarious balancing act, bridging the divides between foreign journalists and the people who live and work in fixers' own communities.\nIn this book, Lindsay Palmer reveals the lives and struggle of those performing some of the most important work in international news. Drawing on interviews with 75 fixers around the world, Palmer is the first researcher to illuminate fixers' own rich narratives, offering a glimpse of how difficult it is to play the role of cultural mediator, both in and out of conflict zones. A news fixers' is not simply administrative; rather, the fixer's engagement with the story is editorial and, more importantly, cultural. Each task that a fixer takes on is a creative effort at mediating between different lived experiences of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, politics, community, and nation. Ultimately,\u00a0The Fixers\u00a0offers a different picture of international reporting than most people are accustomed to seeing: one that is more collaborative, more contested, and more fluid in its understanding of \"truth\" in a global, cross-cultural context.\nAbout the Speaker\nLindsay Palmer is an associate professor in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She writes about global journalism from a critical-cultural perspective. Her research has appeared in Critical Studies in Media Communication, the International Journal of Cultural Studies, Journalism Studies, Journalism, the Feminist Review, and Television and New Media, among others. Her first book--entitled Becoming the Story: War Correspondents since 9/11--looked at the dangerous labor of war reporting in the 21st century.\nLunch begins at 11:45.\u00a0Space is limited, RSVP to\u00a0marina.krikorian@asc.upenn.edu,", "endtime": "1:00pm", "event_index": 1568, "location": "Annenberg School for Communication, Room 500", "owner": "Annenberg School of Communication", "speaker": "Lindsay Palmer, University of Wisconsin - Madison", "starttime": "12:00pm", "title": "CARGC Book Talk: Lindsay Palmer, University of Wisconsin - Madison", "url": "https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/events/cargc-book-talk-lindsay-palmer-university-wisconsin-madison"},

In 1991 French press magnate Jean-Louis Servan-Schreiber bought into economic weekly La Vie Economique a deal that was remarkable for its endorsement by the monarchy and being technically illegal according to prohibitions against foreign ownership in Morocco\u2019s press code. During this time, Servan-Schreiber used financial journalism and the government\u2019s need for transparent economic liberalization as an entry point into broader coverage of Morocco that took the paper in an increasingly generalist direction, broaching topics in politics and society among others. This boundary-pushing approach at a time when politics in particular was largely absent from Moroccan media bleeds over into publications started by his proteg\u00e9s. Tracing back a subsequent generation of taboo-challenging media owners and operators to their time at LVE under Servan-Schreiber offers insight into the establishing logics of the independent press in the context of neoliberal globalization and accompanying shifts in media-state relations. I argue that financial journalism and the economic press set the stage for a revitalization of the independent press in Morocco that is characterized by recognition of media\u2019s role as a both facilitator for global capital and an increasingly powerful player in the realm of geopolitics. Additionally, on the domestic front, the economic press paves the way for the reentry of politics into public discourse and a liberal approach that attempts to work within the constraints of capital while not eschewing critique.\u00a0\nAbout the Speaker\nAnnemarie Iddins is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication at Fairfield University and a Spring 2020 CARGC Faculty Fellow.

Now reaching global audiences across the Middle East, the Balkans, Latin America, and to a certain extent Europe, television dramas constitute influential media contraflows from Turkey. In this talk, I will propose to understand the formation of authoritarianism in Turkey through this specific realm of popular culture. Drawing on four-year-long ethnographic research, I will demonstrate how industrial actors \u2013 above and below the line \u2013 contribute to the formation of authoritarian politics. Challenging leader-centric and electoral explanations, I argue that authoritarian populism makes and remakes itself through industry professionals\u2019 masculinist and nationalist imaginaries, as well as their cynical ideologies. In addition, authoritarian populism manifests itself through the despotic labor regime that painfully marks the bodies of workers in this industry. Overall, through an interdisciplinary conversation across media studies, populism studies, and media industry studies, this talk calls for the need to recuperate ideology and the body in understanding contemporary mediated politics and the dynamics of media industries.\nAbout the Speaker\nErgin Bulut researches in the area of political economy of media industries and cultural production, video game studies, media and politics, and critical theory.

It aims to contribute to how social science scholars capture critical aspects of digital communication infrastructures that are not only inaccessible to outsiders and researchers with a non-technical background, but may also be hidden from insiders and specialists. \u00a0To introduce such a method, this presentation will focus on results from code ethnography application in the study of internet interconnection dynamics. The research is built on Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) data collected at internet exchange points (IXPs)\u2014 physical facilities where internet networks interconnect to exchange routes and traffic. It compares two IXPs: IX.br in S\u00e3o Paulo and DE-CIX in Frankfurt, and highlights differences that lead to disparities of power concentration in internet infrastructure between the global North and global South heretofore overlooked in internet governance and internet studies scholarship. The concepts of infrastructural interdependencies and giant internet nodes are presented. \nAbout the Speaker\nFernanda R. Rosa is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication. Her work applies a sociotechnical lens to the study of internet interconnection politics to unveil the social, political and economic aspects that arise from internet infrastructure. Specifically, her work shows how unbalanced relations of power in internet interconnection arrangements challenge values embedded in local indigenous networks. It also addresses how highly privatized dynamics in interconnection facilities known as Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) exacerbate interdependencies between the global North and the global South, and raise human rights questions in face of surveillance in contemporary communication infrastructures.\nHer research has received awards from American University, Columbia University and the Carnegie Corporation of New York. In 2018, her paper \u201cInternet Infrastructure as a Network of Relations, Devices and Expectations\u201d won one of the Best Student Paper Awards at the TPRC 46 (Research Conference on Communications, Information and Internet Policy). Previously, she co-authored the book Mobile Learning in Brazil (Zinnerama, 2015) on technology and education issues.\nFernanda holds a Ph.D. in Communication from American University, in Washington DC, a Masters in Management and Public Policy from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas (FGV), and a BA in Social Sciences from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP).\nLunch begins at 11:45.\u00a0Space is limited, RSVP to\u00a0marina.krikorian@asc.upenn.edu.", "endtime": "1:00pm", "event_index": 1572, "location": "3901 Walnut Street, 6th Floor", "owner": "Annenberg School of Communication", "speaker": " Fernanda Rosa, Annenberg School", "starttime": "12:00pm", "title": "CARGC Colloquium: Fernanda Rosa, Annenberg School", "url": "https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/events/cargc-colloquium-fernanda-rosa-annenberg-school"},

Prior to that, Dr. Subbarao was Finance Secretary to the Government of India (2007-08) and Secretary to the Prime Minister\u2019s Economic Advisory Council (2005-07).Dr. Subbarao joined the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) in 1972, topping the highly competitive civil services entry examination in that year. As a career civil servant, he worked in various positions in the state government of Andhra Pradesh and in the federal government of India. He was a Lead Economist in the World Bank (1999 - 2004).Dr. Subbarao studied at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur and later at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur. He went to Graduate School at Ohio State University where he got an MS in Economics and later was a Humphrey Fellow at MIT studying Public Finance. He got his Ph.D. from Andhra University.Dr. Subbarao began as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India just a week before the global financial crisis erupted in full in mid-September 2008, and he led the effort to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the Indian economy and to institute economic and financial sector reforms reflecting the lessons of the crisis.In his capacity first as Finance Secretary and later as Governor, RBI, Dr. Subbarao was alternate Governor for India on the Governing Boards of the World Bank and the IMF. He participated actively in the G 20 meetings, the meetings of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (of the IMF), bi-monthly meetings of Governors at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, the Asian Consultative Committee of central bank Governors, and a host of other international committees and conferences where his views were respected for the emerging market perspective he brought to bear on the discussions.About the Lecture:India grew at a rapid clip during Prime Minister Modi\u2019s first term (2014-19), occasionally gaining bragging rights as the fastest growing large economy in the world.

To investigate this regional variation in disease risk and the potential basis of resilience of `cold spots\u2019, the RURAL (Risk Underlying Rural Areas Longitudinal) Cohort Study, recently funded by NHLBI, will recruit and study 4000 young-to-middle aged men and women from different race/ethnicity groups living in six high risk and four lower risk poor rural counties in four Southern states. This study will reach these communities using a mobile van, and measure levels of both protective and harmful influences in the people and their neighborhoods, hoping to understand what causes the high burden of heart and lung disease in these rural Southern regions and how to improve and prevent it. In this talk, we will provide an overview of the RURAL study including its goals and long-term vision and its study design, and discuss the key leadership roles of the Statistical and Data Coordinating Center for the RURAL study which is located at Penn.

Each eye is corrected for a different distance, causing one image to be blurrier than the other. Millions of people have monovision corrections, but little is known about how interocular blur differences affect motion perception. Here, we report that blur differences cause a previously unknown motion illusion that makes people dramatically misperceive the distance and three-dimensional direction of moving objects. The effect occurs because the blurry and sharp images are processed at different speeds. For moving objects, the mismatch in processing speed causes a neural disparity, which results in the misperceptions. A variant of a 100-year-old stereo-motion phenomenon called the Pulfrich effect, the illusion poses an apparent paradox: blur reduces contrast, and contrast reductions are known to cause neural processing delays, but our results indicate that blurry images are processed milliseconds more quickly. We resolve the paradox with known properties of the early visual system, show that the misperceptions can be severe enough to impact public safety, and demonstrate that the misperceptions can be eliminated with novel combinations of noninvasive ophthalmic interventions. The fact that substantial perceptual errors are caused by millisecond differences in processing speed highlights the exquisite temporal calibration required for accurate perceptual estimation. The fact that these misperceptions are generally rare indicates how well the visual system tends to be calibrated. The motion illusion\u2014the reverse Pulfrich effect\u2014and the paradigm we use to measure it should help reveal how optical and image properties impact temporal processing, an important but understudied issue in vision and visual neuroscience.

From the modeling side, this leads to an urge to develop data-driven methods for learning models in/for large-scale interconnected systems. In this seminar the main developments and challenges in this area will be highlighted. Besides setting up a modelling framework for directed networks, we will address problems of local identification of a particular part of the network, including the selection of the appropriate signals to be measured. Machine learning tools are incorporated for mitigating the model structure selection problems. The concept of network identifiability is introduced and graph- based methods are shown for verifying identifiability, providing conditions for the location of excitation signals in the network graph. Finally, the theory is extended to deal with undirected networks as present in diffusively coupled physical networks.", "endtime": "12:00 PM", "event_index": 1608, "location": "Towne 337,  220 S 33rd St", "owner": "Electrical and Systems Engineering (ESE)", "speaker": "Paul M.J.

Modeling-based bone formation (MBF) i.e. bone formation without prior activation of osteoclastic resorption, only occurs during growth, healing, and in response to external mechanical loading. Remodeling-based bone formation (RBF), which is tightly coupled with bone resorption by osteoclasts, plays a predominant role maintaining skeletal health. Recent studies identified the activation of MBF as an important mechanism by which anabolic agents, such as intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH), rapidly elicit new bone formation. Due to the challenge of differentiating between MBF and RBF on a thick bone specimen, the quality of the bone tissue generated through these two distinct cellular mechanisms is unknown. Therefore, the goal of this study is to (1) develop an imaging method that can be coupled with a mechanical testing platform for reliable identification and examination of material properties of MBF and RBF on thick bone sections, and (2) define the differences in material properties of trabecular bone tissue from MBF and RBF.", "endtime": "1:00 PM", "event_index": 1632, "location": "CRB Auditorium,  415 Curie Boulevard", "owner": "Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM)", "speaker": "Wei-Ju Tseng\nPh.D. Candidate, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, University of Pennsylvania\nAdvisor: Xiaowei Sherry Liu", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "title": "MEAM Special Seminar: \u201cDifferences in Material Properties of Trabecular Bone Tissue from Modeling- and Remodeling-Based Bone Formation in Rats\u201d", "url": "https://events.seas.upenn.edu/event/meam-special-seminar-differences-in-material-properties-of-trabecular-bone-tissue-from-modeling-and-remodeling-based-bone-formation-in-rats/"},

We find robust evidence suggesting that IO is positively associated with future systemic risk.

Our results also suggest a trading mechanism through which active, and transient institutions in particular, play a role in propagating systemic risk. We find the relationship exists when there is both overlapping and non-overlapping ownership of banks, and the result is concentrated when there are low monitoring incentives for institutional owners. Furthermore, we find disclosure may play a role in mitigating the transmission of systemic risk by institutional investors. Overall, our results should be of interest to regulators, who have called for institutional investors to play a larger role in bank monitoring, and more broadly to the academic literature that tends to assume the benefits of IO without adequate consideration of the potential costs.", "endtime": "1:20pm", "event_index": 1665, "location": "SH DH 1201", "owner": "Accounting Department (Wharton)", "speaker": "Christina Synn\nUNC", "starttime": " 12:00pm ", "title": "Institutional Ownership and the Propagation of Systemic Risk among Banks", "url": "https://accounting.wharton.upenn.edu/research/workshops/"},

We investigate the effects of disclosing investigations using confidential records on all opened investigations, regardless of outcome.

Nonetheless, even when no charges are ultimately brought, firms that voluntarily disclose an investigation have significant negative returns, underperforming non-sanctioned firms that stayed silent by 12.7% for a year after the investigation begins. Consistent with limited investor attention, disclosing in a more prominent manner is associated with worse returns. CEOs who disclose an investigation are also 14% more likely to experience turnover.

However, RPE can also destroy shareholder value by encouraging executives to implement excessively aggressive product market strategies to improve their relative standing through costly sabotage. We posit that explicit collusion via cartel membership restricts a firm's ability to engage in sabotage, thereby improving the net benefits of RPE, and document that: (1) cartel members are more likely to use RPE, especially in more concentrated markets; (2) conditional on using RPE, cartel members include more economically similar firms in their peer group; (3) firms are differentially likely to drop RPE from their executives' pay package within one year of their cartel being dissolved by a plausibly exogenous intervention; and (4) RPE is associated with higher advertising spending, but only among non-cartel firms.

We find that firms subject to DPAs experience significantly lower buy-and-hold returns in the one-to three-year period following the DPA compared with prosecuted firms. These results are consistent with shareholders experiencing a wealth loss when a firm enters into a DPA. We also show that DPA firms experience negative real consequences following the initiation of a DPA, relative to prosecuted firms, as measured by decreases in both sales and the number of employees.These results are inconsistent with the idea that DPAs reduce the collateral damage to stakeholders who are not responsible for the crimes committed by the organization (i.e., innocent parties).Keywords: Non-prosecution agreements, deferred prosecution agreements, prosecution, litigation, financial performance. and the fear of unintended consequences has been the driving force behind the proliferation of this alternative mechanism to prosecution, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first empirical study to examine the impact of DPAs on longer-term firm performance.Although the use of DPAs has increased significantly in the past decade, the practice has not been without controversy (Kaal and Lacine, 2014). Proponents of their increased use argue that the agreements are a more efficient method to discipline firms for failing to comply with laws.Given the bargaining power residing with the government in a DPA, corporate changes can be enacted without: 1) the government incurring costs associated with litigation while obtaining the burden of proof to secure criminal conviction; and, 2) creating unintended collateral damage to the 3 economy and other stakeholders, similar to those resulting from the indictment of ArthurAndersen.Those opposing the use of DPAs, however, point out that these agreements are extrajudicial contracts that operate outside of the regular legal system and potentially undermine the rule of law.Further, the extent of bargaining power available to the government agencies allows them to potentially impose overly strict conditions, which may be more costly to firms' stakeholders than any collateral damage arising from prosecution (Greenblum, 2005). Additionally, opponents raise the issue that such agreements may be ineffective due both to the variation in their implementation and difficulty in assessing the extent to which firms comply with each condition set forth in such agreements. In essence, DPAs are viewed by critics as a more lenient way to deal with corporate crime that may be more detrimental to shareholders and other stakeholders than litigation.Ultimately, it is an open question as to whether DPAs are a more or a less effective method compared with the alternative of prosecution. Corporate governance and conduct improvements associated with DPAs are mostly internal to the firm and difficult to measure directly. Accordingly, we examine firms' longer-term stock market performance to capture the relative net benefit of being subjected to", "endtime": "1:20pm", "event_index": 1668, "location": "SH DH 1201", "owner": "Accounting Department (Wharton)", "speaker": "Christopher Small\nToronto", "starttime": " 12:00pm ", "title": "The Effect of Deferred Prosecution Agreements on Firm Performance", "url": "https://accounting.wharton.upenn.edu/research/workshops/"},

Drawing insights from the empirical investigation of the modern practice and emerging norm of daughters providing for the elderly and based on an early version of a theory, I have developed the model of Mosaic Familism. I argue that an emerging bilateral-multi-nuclear family system featured by intimate intergenerational interdependence is replacing traditional patrilineal and patriarchal family in contemporary China. My findings show four themes of gender and family changes which constitute core mechanisms of Mosaic Familism. First, an intimate parent-children symbiosis emerges, replacing the patriarchal authoritarian intergenerational relationship. Second, this intergenerational intimacy is featured by an interweaving of money and affections in daughters\u2019 and parents\u2019 daily practices. Third, an emerging bilateral-multi-nuclear family system is in the process of replacing the traditional patrilineal and patriarchal family, driven by different generations of women\u2019s care practices and emotional interaction. Fourth, new gender practices intersect with old patriarchal norms, with patriarchy both seriously challenged and subtly re-strengthened in some aspects.\nYingchun Ji is the Eastern Scholar Professor in the School of Sociology and Political Science at the Shanghai University.

Much of her research is focused on family and gender issues in the Asian institutional and cultural context. In addition to empirical studies using both quantitative and qualitative methods, Dr. Ji has dedicated herself to developing localized theories to understand changing gender and family dynamics in post-reform China, and to understand low-fertility in present China as well as in East Asia from a gender perspective. Currently, Dr. Ji is working on two projects: 1) developing a theory called Mosaic Familism to understand the changing intergenerational dynamics in Chinese families; and 2) conducting a project to understand a voluntarily run Match-making Market by anxious parents in the People\u2019s Park in downtown Shanghai.", "endtime": "1:15pm", "event_index": 1682, "location": "CSCC Conference Room, Perelman 418, 133 S. 36th St.", "owner": "Center for the Study of Contemporary China", "speaker": "Yingchun Ji, Professor of Sociology and Political Science,\u00a0Shanghai University", "starttime": "12:00pm", "title": "Mosaic Familism: Women Providing for the Elderly and Reinstitutionalization of Chinese Family", "url": "https://cscc.sas.upenn.edu/events/2020/04/06/mosaic-familism-women-providing-elderly-and-reinstitutionalization-chinese-family"},

I collect criminal records for 90,000 low-income parents who have been convicted of a crime in Colombia, which I combine with administrative data on the educational attainment of their children. I exploit exogenous variation in parental incarceration resulting from the random assignment of defendants to judges with different propensities to convict and incarcerate. Because I only observe defendants who are convicted, my identification strategy differs from previous judge IV applications. To address this challenge, I depart from the single dimension threshold setting, and model conviction and incarceration in the context of a multiple dimension threshold crossing model, thereby defining a new policy-relevant causal parameter. I find that conditional on conviction, parental incarceration increases education by 0.7 years for children whose parents are on the margin of incarceration.\u00a0", "endtime": "01:00 PM", "event_index": 1686, "location": "McNeil Building, RM 395\n3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Dapartment of Criminology", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "title": "Criminology Colloquium Series: Carolina Arteaga", "url": "https://crim.sas.upenn.edu/events/criminology-colloquium-series-carolina-arteaga"},

The standard explanation for the lasting trend in incarceration is that the sentencing policy choices from the 1980s and 1990s permanently increased punitiveness: i.e. a long-standing period effect. Our paper examines an alternative explanation that the crime waves in the 1980s and 1990s created cohort differences in incarceration over the life course that changed the level of incarceration even decades after the crime wave. With individual level longitudinal sentencing data from 1972 to 2016 in North Carolina, we find clear evidence that period effects played a relatively minor role in comparison to cohort effects in the secular trends in incarceration. The birth cohorts that reach prime age of crime during the 1990s crime wave have elevated rates of incarceration throughout their observed life course. The key mechanism for their elevated incarceration rates decades after the crime wave is the accumulation of extended criminal history under a sentencing structure that systematically escalates punishment for those with priors.\u00a0", "endtime": "01:00 PM", "event_index": 1689, "location": "", "owner": "Dapartment of Criminology", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "title": "Criminology Colloquium Series: Shawn Bushway", "url": "https://crim.sas.upenn.edu/events/criminology-colloquium-series-shawn-bushway"},

Rapidly evolving centromeres can drive karyotype evolution and speciation. Centromeres are typically embedded in highly repetitive regions of genomes and thus pose major challenges for genome assembly. We therefore know little about the organization of centromeric DNA in most organisms, which limits our understanding of role of DNA sequences in centromere function. \u00a0We combine long-read sequencing with molecular and cytological approaches to study centromere organization in Drosophila species. We discovered that in D. melanogaster, centromeres contain unique islands of complex DNA embedded in satellites. The only sequences shared between centromeres on all chromosomes is a non-LTR retroelement called G2/Jockey-3. We study patterns of variation in D. melanogaster centromeres within and between population from across the world to show that the centromere islands are conserved across populations but have large structural variants involving retroelements. Our results suggest that G2/Jockey-3 is recently active and that natural selection shapes its genomic distribution. To determine if centromeres are conserved between species, we generated deep PacBio sequencing data for three sister species of the simulans clade: D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. mauritiana. We discovered that while the satellites at simulans clade centromeres are distinct from those in D. melanogaster, G2/Jockey-3 is abundant in centromere islands in these species. We therefore reveal a striking level of conservation among otherwise rapidly evolving sequences at centromeres. Retroelements are associated with centromeres across plants, fungi, and animals, and therefore may be an important feature of centromere biology.\nLab website", "endtime": "5:00pm", "event_index": 1740, "location": " Tedori Family Auditorium, Levin Building", "owner": "Department of Biology", "speaker": "", "starttime": "4:00pm", "title": "Retroelements are conserved features of Drosophila centromeres", "url": "http://www.bio.upenn.edu/node/6808"},

Areas more exposed to these lenders experienced a large relative rise in transaction volume driven by a small group of speculators, and these areas simultaneously witnessed an amplified housing boom and bust.

Exploiting UberX's entry crossed with a location's ex-ante accessibility, I measure how establishment net creation responds to changes in access. I find that previously inaccessible areas add twice as many net new restaurants in the post period than in the pre-period, boosting net creation rates from 4% to 8%. I find no response in industries less sensitive to travel choice, such as dentists or dry cleaners. These results are robust to a variety of inaccessibility definitions, are not driven by the most public transit reliant cities, and show no evidence of industry dispersion in the pre-period. As these areas become more productive and desirable, house prices rise by 11-15% on average, as firms and residents compete for newly desirable locations. Tracking travel patterns, emissions increase by 11% in formerly inaccessible areas, and in New York City, travelers are 9% more likely to be dropped off by taxi in inaccessible locations; both consistent with consumers' substituting away from public transit in favor of private cars to access new locations. Put together, a 9-11% increase in travel is associated with a 4% additional growth in restaurants. I frame these reduced form results using a modified spatial equilibrium framework, in which resident welfare depends on the trade-off between accessibility benefits and housing costs. I find that residential welfare increases  3-6.5% more in  accessible locations, with all of the welfare gains of improved travel offset by rising residential housing prices in inaccessible locations.", "endtime": "05:30 PM", "event_index": 1744, "location": "265 JMHH", "owner": "Applied Economics Workshop (Wharton)", "speaker": "Caitlin Gorback (Applied Economics)", "starttime": "04:00 PM", "title": "Caitlin Gorback (Applied Economics)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/"},

Conversely, strong property rights over innovations can impede cumulative research and lead to inefficient duplication of effort. These effects are particularly acute in natural resource exploration, where discoveries are spatially correlated and property rights over neighboring regions are allocated to competing firms. I use data from offshore oil exploration in the UK to quantify the effects of information externalities on the speed and efficiency of exploration by estimating a dynamic structural model of the firm's exploration problem. Firms drill exploration wells to learn about the spatial distribution of oil and face a trade-off between drilling now and delaying exploration to learn from other firms' wells. I show that removing the incentive to free ride brings exploration forward by about 1 year and increases industry surplus by 31%. Allowing perfect information flow between firms raises industry surplus by a further 38%. Counterfactual policy simulations highlight the trade off between discouraging free riding and encouraging cumulative research - stronger property rights over exploration well data increase the rate of exploration, while weaker property rights increase the efficiency and speed of learning but reduce the rate of exploration. Spatial clustering of each firm's drilling licenses both reduces the incentive to free ride and increases the speed of learning", "endtime": "06:30 PM", "event_index": 1745, "location": "265 JMHH", "owner": "Applied Economics Workshop (Wharton)", "speaker": "Charles Hodgson (Stanford)", "starttime": "05:00 PM", "title": "Charles Hodgson (Stanford)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/"},

This paper considers whether large infrastructure investments should continue to favour coastal areas. I use a dynamic spatial equilibrium framework and detailed georeferenced data from Vietnam to examine this issue and find evidence that coastal favouritism has significant costs. Road investments concentrated in coastal regions between 2000 and 2010 had positive returns but would have been outperformed by allocations concentrated further inland even in the absence of sea level rise. Future inundation renders the status quo significantly less efficient. Under a central sea level rise scenario, welfare gains 72% higher could have been achieved by a foresighted allocation avoiding the most vulnerable regions.

In this paper, I provide new estimates of the income effect of welfare transfers on individual labor supply. I leverage novel social security administrative data on the universe\u00a0 of survivor insurance payments in Italy, and useful quasi-experimental variation in the benefits received by surviving spouses on the basis of their spouse's death date. I implement a regression discontinuity design in spousal death date to identify the effect of unearned income on labor supply, earnings and program substitution. Benefit losses trigger tantamount increases in earned income, implying a marginal propensity to earn out of unearned income of approximately -1. Extensive-margin responses - in the form of both increased labor-market entry by younger survivors and delayed retirement by older survivors - emerge as the main driving force behind the income response. Program substitution also appears to be a relevant margin of adjustment. I consider alternative explanations for the large income response. Finally, I discuss the normative implications of my findings. I propose a revealed-preference approach to estimate the value\u00a0 of transfers based on participation responses. I demonstrate that large participation responses to realized benefit drops are revealing of large implicit valuations of welfare transfers in the widowhood state, and of substantial welfare gains from more generous survivor insurance.", "endtime": "06:30 PM", "event_index": 1749, "location": "265 JMHH", "owner": "Applied Economics Workshop (Wharton)", "speaker": "Giulia Giupponi (LSE)", "starttime": "05:00 PM", "title": "Giulia Giupponi (LSE)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/"},

The Case of Unlimited Vacation\nABSTRACT: This paper addresses the birth of risky perks that endow flexibility and autonomy to workers in startup companies. While potentially offering recruitment and performance benefits to firms, these perks also come with two types of risks--agency risks due to the possibility of abuse as well as social risks that may limit the extent of gains. Focusing on an increasingly popular perk--unlimited vacation, this paper adopts a multi-method approach and ask: Does unlimited vacation benefit firms, and how? What can firms do to minimize the risks? Motivated by a content analysis, I develop a theoretical model that formalizes conjectures about the micro-foundations for using unlimited vacation to maximize the value of human assets. Predictions are tested in two studies. Study 1 conducts a randomized controlled experiment with an online labor market through a one-month job. In a 2x3x2 design, I vary (i) worker ability (high or low) (ii) work contract (unlimited vacation, capped vacation, or a choice between the two), and (iii) firing threat (strong or weak). I find that unlimited vacation (1) is three times more attractive to high ability workers, (2) increases worker productivity by 20-30%, or 51% when bundled with other practices, and (3) induces extra outputs from happier workers. An organizational system with a strong firing threat reduces slacking rate by 45%. Study 2 confirms the recruitment and performance benefits using a panel of employee survey and vacation data from a large technology firm. In addition, I find that supportive social dynamics (i.e., team and manager relationships) strengthen the gains in the performance stage. This paper demonstrates how unlimited vacation can help managers gain and sustain competitive advantage through a highly skilled, productive, and motivated workforce.", "endtime": "05:30 PM", "event_index": 1750, "location": "265 JMHH", "owner": "Applied Economics Workshop (Wharton)", "speaker": "Jiayi Bao (Applied Ecnomics)", "starttime": "04:00 PM", "title": "Jiayi Bao (Applied Ecnomics)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/"},

Do parents value school impacts on high-stakes tests, longer-run outcomes, or both? To answer the first question, we apply quasi-experimental methods to data from Trinidad and Tobago and estimate the causal impacts of individual schools on several outcomes. Schools' impacts on high-stakes tests are weakly related to impacts on low-stakes tests, dropout, crime, teen motherhood, and formal labor market participation. To answer the second question, we link estimated school impacts to parents' ranked lists of schools and employ discrete choice models to estimate parental preferences. Parents value schools that causally improve high-stakes test scores conditional on average outcomes, proximity, and peer quality. Consistent with parents valuing the multidimensional output of schools, parents of high-achieving girls prefer schools that increase formal labor market participation, and parents of high-achieving boys prefer schools that reduce crime", "endtime": "05:30 PM", "event_index": 1752, "location": "265 JMHH", "owner": "Applied Economics Workshop (Wharton)", "speaker": "Kirabo Jackson (Northwestern)", "starttime": "04:00 PM", "title": "Kirabo Jackson (Northwestern)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/"},

This paper provides an analysis of state-sponsored auto-enrollment plans and how their default contribution rates affect employee saving behavior. OregonSaves is a plan that mandates employers to provide access to OregonSaves if they offer no employer-sponsored plan. Using these data, we show that about half of workers provided access to OregonSaves participate, and around three-quarters of participants save at the default 5% contribution rate. We also develop a model of the optimal default contribution rate using an empirically implementable sufficient statistics framework. The optimal default rate is shaped by the marginal welfare internality of savings due to the underestimation of future utility, and the marginal welfare internality of action due to the overestimation of the cost of switching to a non-default saving option. We also discuss the implications of default saving policies taking into account Social Security and means-tested social transfers.

Such protections come at a cost: we are forced to look in the places where we ex ante expect there to be a treatment effect.

We describe a machine learning approach for making such discoveries when the outcome data is rich and the treatment effect potentially multi-faceted, as is the case with many important social interventions.  We describe a testing procedure that takes a black-box prediction algorithm and produces exact p-values.

To overcome the fact that factors that affect a worker's outside options may also impact her productivity at her current job, we develop a strategy that isolates changes in a worker's information about her outside options. This strategy relies on the fact that individuals often learn about jobs through social networks, including former coworkers. We implement this strategy using employer-employee data from Denmark that contain monthly information on wages and detailed measures of worker skills. We find that increases in labor demand at former coworkers' current firms lead to job-to-job mobility and wage growth. Consistent with theory, larger changes are necessary to induce a job-to-job transition than to induce a wage gain. Specification tests leveraging alternative sources of variation suggest these responses are indeed due to information rather than unobserved demand shocks. Impacts on earnings are concentrated among workers in the top half of the skill distribution.

Instead, they increasingly rely on schemes that face less public resistance, such as driving restrictions or license-plate bans, notwithstanding the literature has shown they typically result in more congestion and pollution by encouraging the purchase of additional, older, and more polluting vehicles. With the help of a transport model calibrated to capture Santiago's current congestion and pollution reality, we advance a restriction proposal that prevents the purchase of additional vehicles while leaving consumers of all income groups better off: driving restrictions with toll and vintage exemptions, where the toll collection is spent in public-transport fare reductions and quality improvements. A driver of a restricted car has always the option to pay a toll (daily pass) to have it exempted, but as long as the car's pollution level is below a certain threshold. Under the more ambitious format ---five days restriction, 14 dollars toll, and 2000 and 2005 vintage thresholds for petrol and diesel, respectively--- per-year net benefits from lighter traffic and cleaner air amount to 1200 million dollars (almost 0.5% of the country's GDP).", "endtime": "09:00 PM", "event_index": 1760, "location": "Kleinman Center classroom\u2014Fisher Fine Arts Room 306", "owner": "Energy Economics & Finance Seminar", "speaker": "CANCELED: Juan Pablo Montero (PUC-Chile)", "starttime": "08:00 PM", "title": "CANCELED: Juan Pablo Montero (PUC-Chile)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/energy-economics-finance-seminar/"},

The framework's usefulness and theoretical founding make it a valuable starting point for analyzing misallocations. However, we show this approach is sensitive to model misspecification. The model's mapping from observed production behaviors to isallocative wedges/distortions holds in a single theoretical case, with strict assumptions required on both the demand and supply sides. We demonstrate that applying the HK methodology when there is any deviation from these assumptions will mean \"distortions\" recovered from the data may not be signs of inefficiency. Rather, they may simply reflect demand shifts or movements of the firm along its marginal cost curve, quite possibly in profitable directions. The framework may then not just spuriously identify inefficiencies; it might be more likely to do so precisely for businesses better in some fundamental way than their competitors. Empirical tests in our data, which allow us to separate price and quantity and as such directly test the model's assumptions, suggest the framework's necessary conditions do not hold. We then extend the HK framework to allow for more general demand and supply structures to quantify the discrepancy between the framework and the data. We find substantial deviations, particularly on the demand side. Using a decomposition derived from our extended framework, we find that much of the variation in revenue-based TFP (the measure of distortions in HK) reflects the influence of demand shifts, either directly or through distortions correlated with those shifts. We furthermore show that under general conditions, the variance of revenue-based TFP is not a sufficient statistic for efficiency losses due to misallocation.\u00a0", "endtime": "09:00 PM", "event_index": 1772, "location": "The Ronald O.

In particular, consumer inertia affects the scope of market power. We show that the effects of competition on prices and profits are non-monotonic in the degree of inertia. Further, a model that omits consumer inertia tends to overstate the marginal effect of competition on price, relative to a benchmark that accounts for consumer dynamics.

Using detailed data on lease contracts and the timing of drilling, we show\nempirically that primary term expiration dates have an economically significant impact\non firms' drilling decisions: a large share of wells are drilled just prior to expiration. We\nthen develop a model to explain why primary terms and royalties can help maximize the\nmineral owner's expected revenue from a lease, despite the distortions they generate.\nThe royalty helps the mineral owner extract some of the information rents of the firm\nbut also delays drilling; the primary term partially mitigates this moral hazard problem\nby encouraging earlier drilling. We examine how these contracts affect drilling and the\npayouts to mineral owners and firms in the Haynesville Shale formation of Louisiana.", "endtime": "09:00 PM", "event_index": 1780, "location": "The Ronald O.

Historically, our lab has been interested in neuronal mechanisms of anesthesia. Anesthetics have been indispensable\u00a0for medicine for over 100 years, but the mechanisms through which these drugs act in order to produce a state of unconsciousness\u00a0remain mysterious. Questions concerning neuronal mechanisms of anesthesia are very closely related to perhaps the most profound question in neuroscience: What is the relationship between brain activity and conscious subjective experience? Our lab is specifically interested in two related questions. The first question is: What are the properties of neuronal activity that distinguish the conscious from the unconscious state. We proposed a novel theory that in order to be able to respond to a stimulus -- a sine qua non of consciousness -- stability of brain dynamics must be tightly controlled. The brain is never silent, even in the state of deep anesthesia the brain continues to generate complex spontaneous patterns of activity. A stimulus, therefore, acts as a perturbation to this ongoing dynamics. If the dynamics of the brain were too stable, any perturbation will quickly dampen. Conversely, if the dynamics were too unstable, then any perturbation would grow without bound. From this simple intuition it follows that, in order to be able to consciously perceive\u00a0 a stimulus, the dynamics must be precisely balanced between the stable and the unstable regime.A related, but distinct question is how is the brain able to recover consciousness after its activity has been profoundly disrupted by anesthetics? We have demonstrated that en route to recovery from deep anesthesia, the brain traversed through several discrete transiently stabilized activity patterns. The transitions among these patterns are highly structured such that certain activity patterns form hubs arrival into which are a pre-requisite for further recovery. While, the stabilization of activity patterns greatly shrinks the \"activity space\", the structured transitions among them form a dynamical scaffold that gives rise to\u00a0 boot sequence which ultimately allows recovery of consciousness to occur on a physiological time scale.A more recent approach in our lab is to model neuronal dynamics outside of the context of anesthesia. A technological revolution has enabled massively parallel recordings of neuronal activity using high density electrodes and imaging techniques. Yet, the theoretical approaches needed to extract meaningful information from such complex datasets is critically lacking. Motivated by statistical mechanics approaches we developed a modeling approach for extracting dynamical structures from multivariate, nonlinear, and noisy recordings of neuronal activity. We validated the predictions of this modeling approach using published datasets of whole brain imaging in nematode\u00a0C. elegans.\u00a0Using this approach, we can predict when the nematode will switch direction of locomotion. Remarkably, the predictions of the model of macroscopic dynamics are valid despite consistent individual differences in the patterns of activation of individual identified neurons during execution of the same locomotor behavior in genetically identical worms. This suggests that one cannot necessarily expect biophysically realistic models of the nervous systems to be generalizable across individuals. Rather, this observation points to the fact that evolutionary constraints operate at the level of macroscopic dynamics which assure that an adequate behavioral is implemented. We are exploring the consequences of this hypothesis by training artificial neuronal networks on a variety of behavioral tasks and are studying the relationship between network dynamics and task demands.A pizza lunch will be served.", "endtime": "12:30 PM", "event_index": 1795, "location": "Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building", "owner": "Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI)", "speaker": " Proekt Lab", "starttime": "11:30 AM", "title": "CNI Seminar: Proekt Lab", "url": "https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-proekt-lab"},

  {"date": "Wednesday, December 4, 2019", "date_dt": "04-12-2019", "description": " Many practical applications of machine learning involve multiclass learning problems with a large number of classes. Multiclass learning with the standard 0-1 loss is fairly well understood; however, in practice, applications with large numbers of classes often require performance to be measured via a different, problem-specific loss. What\nis the right way to design principled and efficient learning algorithms for multiclass problems with general losses? From a theoretical standpoint, an elegant approach for designing statistically consistent learning algorithms is via the design of convex calibrated surrogate losses. From a practical standpoint, an approach that is often favored is that of output coding, which reduces multiclass learning to a set of simpler binary classification problems (with the\nwidely used one-vs-all reduction being a specific instance of this approach). In this talk, I will discuss recent progress in bringing together these seemingly disparate approaches under a unifying lens to develop statistically consistent and computationally efficient learning algorithms for a wide range of problems, in some cases recovering\nexisting state-of-the-art algorithms, and in other cases providing new ones.
