To some degree, open-file policies have been adopted as a response to reducing wrongful convictions and deterring prosecutor\u2019s withholding of exculpatory evidence. In the context of trials, prosecutors must turn over exculpatory evidence to the defense; to not do so is considered misconduct (i.e., Brady violations). However, in the context of guilty pleas--which account for 95% of convictions--whether, and what forms of, exculpatory evidence need be disclosed is much less clear.

Specifically, for each equation, the new method automatically decides (i) whether the VAR coefficients are constant or time-varying, and (ii)    whether the error variance is constant or has a stochastic volatility specification.Using US datasets of various dimensions, we find evidence that the VAR coefficients and error variances in some, but not all, equations are time varying.

The framework's usefulness and theoretical founding make it a valuable starting point for analyzing misallocations. However, we show this approach is sensitive to model misspecification. The model's mapping from observed production behaviors to misallocative wedges/distortions holds in a single theoretical case, with strict assumptions required on both the demand and supply sides. We demonstrate that applying the HK methodology when there is any deviation from these assumptions will mean \"distortions\" recovered from the data may not be signs of inefficiency. Rather, they may simply reflect demand shifts or movements of the firm along its marginal cost curve, quite possibly in profitable directions. The framework may then not just spuriously identify inefficiencies; it might be more likely to do so precisely for businesses better in some fundamental way than their competitors. Empirical tests in our data, which allow us to separate price and quantity and as such directly test the model's assumptions, suggest the framework's necessary conditions do not hold. We then extend the HK framework to allow for more general demand and supply structures to quantify the discrepancy between the framework and the data. We find substantial deviations, particularly on the demand side. Using a decomposition derived from our extended framework, we find that much of the variation in revenue-based TFP (the measure of distortions in HK) reflects the influence of demand shifts, either directly or through distortions correlated with those shifts. We furthermore show that under general conditions, the variance of revenue-based TFP is not a sufficient statistic for efficiency losses due to misallocation. Research has established the existence of extensive heterogeneity among producers, even within narrowly defined markets. Enormous variations in establishment and firm sizes and productivity levels are ubiquitous in the data. Researchers and policymakers who focus on productivity growth have taken a keen interest in the covariance of producers' size and productivity levels, because the extent to which the market succeeds in allocating activity across producers so that they are the \"right\" sizes (that is, they are as large as a social planner would want them to be given their relative productivity levels) affects market-, industry-, and economywide productivity.\nJohnA particular approach in this research genre attempts to measure \"misallocations\": the presence of wedges or distortions that cause producers to deviate from their socially efficient size. One of the seminal papers embodying this approach and introducing what has become the standard methodology for analysis of misallocations is Hsieh and Klenow (2009). The HsiehKlenow method combines considerable empirical power and flexibility with a straightforward measurement algorithm. From standard production microdata-revenues, along with labor and capital inputs-one can extract two producer-period-specific \"wedges.\" One distorts the producer's input mix away from the optimal frictionless factor intensity (and through this distorts the producer's size as well), and another directly distorts the producer's size.

Our main result is that, nonetheless, the following implementation revelation principle holds: an outcome is implementable in sequential equilibrium if and only if it is implementable in (canonical) CPPBE, or equivalently if and only if it is a sequential communication For helpful comments, we thank", "endtime": "5:30pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 101, "location": "PCPSE Room 101 \n          United States", "owner": "Department of Economics", "speaker": "Takuo Sugaya\n\n      Stanford University", "starttime": "4:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "The Revelation Principle in Multistage Games", "url": "https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/events/revelation-principle-multistage-games", "suggest_candidates": ["PCPSE", "Department of Economics", "Economics", "Takuo Sugaya", "Stanford University", "CPPBE"]},

We call such acquisitions \"killer acquisitions.\" We develop a parsimonious model illustrating this phenomenon. Using pharmaceutical industry data, we show that acquired drug projects are less likely to be developed when they overlap with the acquirer's existing product portfolio, especially when the acquirer's market power is large due to weak competition or distant patent expiration. Conservative estimates indicate about 6% of acquisitions in our sample are killer acquisitions. These acquisitions disproportionately occur just below thresholds for antitrust scrutiny.JEL Classification: O31, L41, G34, L65", "endtime": "5:00pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 138, "location": "PCPSE Room 100 \n          United States", "owner": "Department of Economics", "speaker": "Florian Ederer\n\n      Yale University", "starttime": "3:30pm", "summary": "", "title": "Killer Acquisitions *", "url": "https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/events/killer-acquisitions", "suggest_candidates": ["PCPSE", "Department of Economics", "Economics", "Yale University", "Killer Acquisitions", "JEL Classification", "O31"]},

In this talk, I suggest that each of these strategies faces its own attendant downsides, and that pursuit of both strategies\u00a0(by different thinkers) compounds the difficulties. That both kinds of approaches are advocated is, I think, illustrative of the problems plaguing the concept of levels\u00a0of organization.

I suggest that, after a period of resistance against Persian rule under Darius and Xerxes, Chaldean astrology emerged from a new climate of collaboration and assimilation under the later Achaemenids. I then look at developments after the fall of the Persian empire: Seleucus of Seleucia (ca. 150 BCE), I argue, exemplifies a period of exceptionally fertile intellectual crosspollination, when leading Chaldeans drew on Babylonian datasets and observational techniques to intervene in Greek philosophical debates.

Dependent happenings are those in which the frequency of the happening depends on the number of individuals affected such as in most infectious diseases. Due to dependent happenings, interventions in infectious diseases can have several different kinds of effects. Demonstrating indirect effects of vaccination can have important consequences for public health policy. Causal inference using potential outcomes is an experimental paradigm to define estimands and estimators of causal effects of interventions. In infectious diseases, the potential outcome of an individual can depend on the treatment status of other individuals, called interference in causal inference. Defining causal estimands and estimators under interference is complicated. Here we present causal estimands and estimators of direct, indirect, total and overall effects of interventions under interference, with emphasis on vaccination in infectious diseases. We present these in both the two-stage randomized, one-stage randomized, and observational context.\u00a0 We present examples of estimating these different effects for different vaccines using different approaches. We present recent trends in developing these methods that include using networks to allow for individual interference sets, for structured interference, and randomized experiments in large networks.

A significant portion of these health care costs come from hospital spending. To help improve patient outcomes while reducing the cost of care, health care systems have put on a lot of effort into developing innovative interventions/treatments. Thus, determining target patients deemed likely to benefit from the innovative treatments is a key interest. In other words, we want to identify individualized treatment rules (ITRs) for targeted enrollment of patients. In this paper, we use the health care payments (which is a significant component to health care utilization) as our primary outcome. The problem is challenging such that health care payments often follow a mixture distribution with many patients incurring little to no payments over a given period of time and some patients incurring large costs: i.e. semi-continuous. We develop a general framework for estimation of ITRs based on a two-part modeling, where models are estimated for the zero part of the outcome and the positive part separately. To improve estimation performance in high dimensions, we leverage a scientifically-plausible penalty that encourages the signs of coefficients for each variable to agree between the two models. We also develop a highly efficient algorithm for computation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in simulated examples and in a study of two treatment plans of complex case management in a major health system.", "endtime": " 4:30pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 289, "location": "701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "3:30pm ", "summary": "", "title": "Biostatistics Seminar Series - Guanhua Chen, PhD", "url": "http://events.med.upenn.edu/cceb/#!view/event/event_id/710427", "suggest_candidates": ["Blockley Hall", "CCEB"]},

Available information in this scenario commonly includes longitudinal measurements from the same subject. Since future information is unknown and may develop dynamically over time, such a predictive problem is challenging. We consider a predictive approach based on modeling the forward intensity function. The forward intensity function approach is appealing for being capable of intrinsically incorporating the future dynamics that affect the stochastic event occurrence. To handle the practical difficulty due to the missing data in the longitudinal measurements, and to accommodate observations at irregularly spaced time points, we propose a smoothed composite likelihood approach for estimating the forward intensity model. Our theoretical analysis establishes the validity of the predictive modeling approach and the smoothed composite likelihood method. Extensive simulations and real data analysis demonstrate the promising performance of the predictive approach.

A long-standing problem with such regression analyses is the lack of effective diagnostic tools for validating model assumptions. The difficulty arises from the fact that an ordinal variable has discrete values that are labeled with, but not, numerical values. The values merely represent ordered categories. In this paper, we propose a surrogate approach to defining residuals for an ordinal outcome Y. The idea is to define a continuous variable S as a \u201csurrogate\u201d of Y and then obtain residuals based on S. For the general class of cumulative link regression models, we study the residual\u2019s theoretical and graphical properties. We show that the residual has null properties similar to those of the common residuals for continuous outcomes. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the residual has power to detect misspecification with respect to 1) mean structures; 2) link functions; 3) heteroscedasticity; 4) proportionality; and 5) mixed populations. The proposed residual also enables us to develop numeric measures for goodness-of-fit using classical distance notions. Our results suggest that compared to a previously defined residual, our residual can reveal deeper insights into model diagnostics. We stress that this work focuses on residual analysis, rather than hypothesis testing. The latter has limited utility as it only provides a single p-value, whereas our residual can reveal what components of the model are mis specified and advise how to make improvements.\n\n\n  This is a joint work with Dungang Liu, University of Cincinnati Lindner College of Business.", "endtime": " 4:30pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 292, "location": "701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "3:30pm ", "summary": "", "title": "Biostatistics Seminar Series - Heping Zhang, PhD", "url": "http://events.med.upenn.edu/cceb/#!view/event/event_id/710452", "suggest_candidates": ["Blockley Hall", "CCEB", "S.

How has a developing country with a spectacularly inefficient financial system, coupled with asset-destroying state-owned firms, managed to create a number of vibrant high-tech firms?\nChina's domestic financial system fails most private firms by neglecting to give them sufficient support to pursue technological upgrading, even while smothering state-favored firms by providing them with too much support. Due to their foreign financing, multinational corporations suffer from neither insufficient funds nor soft budget constraints, but they are insufficiently committed to China's development. Hybrid firms that combine ethnic Chinese management and foreign financing are the hidden dragons driving China's technological development. They avoid the maladies of China's domestic financial system while\u00a0remaining committed to enhancing China's domestic technological capabilities.\nIn sad contrast, China's domestic firms are technological paper tigers. State efforts to build local\u00a0innovation clusters and create national champions have not managed to transform these firms into drivers of technological development.\u00a0These findings upend fundamental debates about China's political economy. Rather than a choice between state capitalism and building domestic market institutions, China has fostered state capitalism even while tolerating the importing of foreign market institutions. While the book's findings suggest that China's state and domestic market institutions are ineffective, the hybrids promise an alternative way to avoid the middle-income trap.

To answer this question, this book\u00a0takes a comparative look at the state building process along China, Myanmar, and Thailand's common borderland area. It shows that the variations in state building among these neighboring countries are the result of an interactive process that occurs across national boundaries. Departing from existing approaches that look at such processes from the angle of singular, bounded territorial states, the book argues that a more fruitful method is to examine how state and nation building in one country can influence, and be influenced by, the same processes across borders. It argues that the success or failure of one country's state building is a process that extends beyond domestic factors such as war preparation, political institutions, and geographic and demographic variables. Rather, it shows that we should conceptualize state building as an interactive process heavily influenced by a \"neighborhood effect.\" Furthermore, the book moves beyond the academic boundaries that divide arbitrarily China studies and Southeast Asian studies by providing an analysis that ties the state and nation building processes in China with those of Southeast Asia.\nEnze Han is\u00a0an Associate Professor at the Department of Politics and Public Administration at the University of Hong Kong.

The workshop will convene at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for the Study of Contemporary China (CSCC) on Saturday, October 26, 2019. CHAIR brings young IR scholars together to share their latest research related to China, build a professional network, and strengthen the academic community that focuses on China and IR topics. CHAIR is also the ideal venue for participants to present revised versions of papers from APSA\u2019s summer 2019 meeting or rough drafts of papers for ISA\u2019s spring 2020 convention. CSCC will reimburse participants up to $500 for accommodation and travel expenses. The bulk of our applications tends to come from the United States and Canada, but we are open to applicants from around the world (those traveling from beyond the US East Coast may be eligible for additional funding).\nWe are looking for approximately ten participants to present works that are part of their dissertations or that they intend to publish. Paper topics span the entire range of the IR sub-field, and abstracts will be chosen based on their level of development, fit with other submissions as part of a cohesive session, and representation of diverse perspectives, methodologies, and institutions. The day-long workshop will consist of four thematically-organized sessions, each comprised of 2-3 presenters and a discussant. Each presenter need only offer a\u00a0brief\u00a0overview of the paper (~5 minutes), to be followed by the discussant\u2019s short, detailed comments on all the papers (~15 minutes). The majority of each session will be devoted to discussion open to all the participants.\u00a0We expect all participants to have read the papers before the workshop, so that workshop discussions on the day can be as fruitful and productive as possible.\nCHAIR offers an opportunity to build a community of young IR scholars who study China, and there will be ample time for socializing throughout the day. In addition to inter-session breaks, a catered lunch will be provided and, at the workshop\u2019s conclusion, we will be pleased to host dinner at a local restaurant for further conversation in a more casual setting. CHAIR thus represents an excellent opportunity for academic enrichment and professional networking. To see past workshop participants and papers, please visit our\u00a0Facebook page.

Rich served for six years as the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He was appointed by President Barack Obama and confirmed by a bipartisan vote of the Senate. Most recently, Rich was a candidate for Governor of Ohio in 2018.\nDuring his tenure, the Consumer Bureau brought enforcement actions that returned over $12 billion to 30 million Americans. They created a consumer response system that gave people a voice; more than 1.3 million people had issues resolved by this means. And they adopted new rules to safeguard the multi-trillion-dollar mortgage market and prevent the kind of problems that led to the financial crisis of 2008 and the deep recession that followed.\nBefore joining the Consumer Bureau, Rich served as Ohio\u2019s Attorney General, where he and his team recovered over $2 billion for Ohio\u2019s retirees, investors, and business owners and took major steps to protect consumers from fraudulent foreclosures and financial predators. He also served as Ohio Treasurer, where he led the State\u2019s banking, investment, debt, and financing activities. Rich previously taught at Ohio State\u2019s law school and served as a State Representative and as Ohio\u2019s first Solicitor General. He has argued seven cases before the US Supreme Court, including by special appointment of both the Clinton and Bush Justice Departments.\nRich is a graduate of Michigan State University\u2019s James Madison College, Oxford University in England, and the University of Chicago Law School.

We hope to see many of you at this event.\n***\nABSTRACT\nEver since Genoese galleys had made their appearance at Bruges in the last quarter of the 13th century, communities of Italian long distance traders had been residing in the Low Countries. In the 16th century, most of them lived in Antwerp, then the commercial metropolis of the Low Countries. However, by the end of that century political and religious turmoil and climatological and demographic transformations had radically altered the trade patterns between the two regions. In 1585, Dutch rebels closed off Antwerp\u2019s access to the sea. Moreover, large parts of Italy became dependent upon the import of grains from the North. Therefore, by the 1590s many Italian merchants had left Antwerp. Subsequently, some of them, mostly Protestant Lucchese bankers, established themselves in Amsterdam.\n\u00a0In the final phases of the Thirty Years war a second wave of Italian migrants joined them. These new migrants mostly stemmed from humbler backgrounds. Moreover, they originated from provincial towns and not from commercial hubs such as Venice or Florence. Silvio Tensini, from Crema in Lombardy and his son in law Francesco Feroni, from Empoli in Tuscany were examples in point. In this lecture, I shall highlight the career of the latter.\n\u00a0Originally, Feroni concentrated on the import of Baltic grains to Italy, for which he established a network that stretched from Archangel in Russia, over Hamburg and Amsterdam to ports along the Tyrrhenian coast, such as Genoa, Livorno or Civitavecchia. Subsequently, he diversified his business and he started to import Spanish wools to the Netherlands and to export Dutch books, scientific instruments and works of art to Italy. Finally, he engaged in the triangular trade across the Atlantic in slaves and sugar. Moreover, Feroni acted as an information broker and an officious representative of the Medici Grand Dukes in the Dutch Republic. Within two decades, he became one of Amsterdam\u2019s wealthiest merchants.\nIn contrast to the first wave of immigrants, Feroni and his peers remained staunch Catholics. Thanks to his Roman contacts, he became an influential figure in the local Catholic minority community and he advocated its interests with the Protestant urban magistrate. Although it seems that Feroni never learnt Dutch, he thus was relatively well integrated.\nFrom the 1660s onward, a third wave of Italian migration followed suit. In response to the aggressive policies of King Louis XIV, Florentine bankers and merchants gradually withdrew from Paris and settled in Amsterdam. They stimulated a new increase both in the maritime and in the overland trade between the Dutch Republic and various Italian states. However, from the 1670s until the early 18th century, the Dutch economy entered a phase of stagnation and by then Amsterdam attracted less foreign merchants. In the 18th century, most Italian immigrants to the Dutch Republic would be artisans instead of merchants.\nFrancesco Feroni\u2019s extra-ordinary career testifies from the dynamic character of the Italian trade during an age in which the economy of the peninsula stagnated. His activities fit into a broader pattern and therefore it is worthwhile to analyze them.", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 410, "location": "Cherpack Seminar Room - 543 Williams Hall", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "summary": "", "title": "Hans Cools (Brueghel Visiting Professor at Penn) on Italians in Early Modern Amsterdam (Cherpack)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2019/10/hans-cools-brueghel-visiting-professor-penn-italians-early-modern-amsterdam-cherpack", "suggest_candidates": ["Italian Studies", "Penn", "Cherpack", "Hans Cools", "the Katholieke Universiteit", "Cools", "the European University Institute", "the University of Amsterdam", "Communities of Strangers", "ABSTRACT", "the Low Countries", "Florence", "Silvio Tensini", "Crema", "Francesco Feroni"]},

We look forward to seeing many of you at this talk!\n\u00a0\n*****\nWhen Richard Wagner created a lowered orchestra pit at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in the 1870s he famously described the decision in terms of concealment; an attempt to hide the means of sound production. In view of the modifications made to numerous opera houses in the decades that followed to create similar orchestra pits, scholars have tended to assume that the Festspielhaus was both the stimulus and model for such spaces. If this tends to flatten out important variations in architectural design between theaters, it also narrates the introduction of orchestra pits from the perspective of audience members alone. While lowered orchestral platforms might have functioned as so-called \u201cmystical chasms\u201d from which sound floated upwards towards awed spectators, these also had a crucial role in the creation of enclosed, protected spaces for musicians.\nThe 1907 construction of the so-called \u201cgolfo mistico\u201d at the preeminent Teatro alla Scala in Milan, under the supervision of Arturo Toscanini, was to a considerable extent an experiment in the creation of a more professional atmosphere than performance at audience level allowed. However much the term golfo mistico betrays a Romantic conception of the space, it was not, I argue, coincidental that the pit was constructed in the same moment that trade unions for musicians were establishing themselves. Meanwhile, musicians were also becoming familiar with other sorts of enclosures calibrated to control acoustics and eliminate distractions, in the form of the earliest sound studios. Placing La Scala\u2019s golfo mistico in the context of these dual developments in the Italian music industry at the time, I reveal the extent of the orchestra pit\u2019s entanglements in a musical landscape which increasingly placed musicians at one remove from their audiences; in tandem, I offer a new framework in which to make sense of the new (and enduring) fashion for this architectural innovation.", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 412, "location": "Music Building, Lerner Center 101", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "Prof. Laura Protano-Biggs", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "summary": "", "title": "Laura Protano-Biggs on the Teatro alla Scala in Milan (Music Building)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2019/11/laura-protano-biggs-teatro-alla-scala-milan-music-building", "suggest_candidates": ["Italian Studies", "Laura Protano-Biggs Laura Protano-Biggs", "Laura Protano-Biggs", "the Peabody Institute", "Johns Hopkins University", "Penn (Music Department", "Richard Wagner", "the Bayreuth Festspielhaus", "Festspielhaus", "Arturo Toscanini", "La Scala\u2019s"]},

Although individual emperors (and empresses) now operate under strict constitutional limits, it is nonetheless true that each emperor (and empress) puts his stamp on the throne. This was clearly the case with Emperor Akihito, and we can expect it in the case of the next emperor, Naruhito.

In 1760, six slaves submitted a confession and plea for mercy to the magistrate of Wuding Prefecture, Yunnan, the immediate superior of their dead master, Nuo Jiayou, a N\u00e9 (or Yi) native chieftain. The slaves had been caught, terrifyingly, between two factions struggling over who would succeed their master as the sole owner of all the lands and peoples within his extensive domain. Their plaint, which named the slaves as its collective author, was written in Chinese, a language they could neither speak nor write. This paper traces their footsteps as they followed their master\u2019s widow to the prefectural capital and found a translator and a cut-rate litigation master to fashion their plaint. I show how the slaves\u2019 own form of spatial literacy, developed through service in their master\u2019s house and participation in his rituals, may have helped them read and navigate the unfamiliar city. Thinking through the specificities of how slaves became writers and readers also helps better delineate the shape of slavery in Ne\u0301 places, which became the designated \u201cslave societies\u201d of Chinese social science despite ubiquitous slavery in every region and economic sector of the Empire. I argue that the native chieftain system itself became a system of bondage in Qing society, confining Ne\u0301 and other \u2018non-Chinese\u2019 to mountain enclaves while extracting their wealth and using their lives in military actions.\nErik Mueggler is Katherine Verdery Collegiate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Law enforcement representatives instead push family members to settle problems on their own. Given such a context, this presentation explores how law and legal norms impact relationships between parents and children after divorce. All dynamics of post-divorce kinship begin from the legal fact that there is no joint custody in Japan. Throughout the postwar, rates of custody being granted to mothers have steadily increased, and currently stand at eighty percent. Moreover sole legal custody is coupled with a cultural belief that a \u201cclean break\u201d can benefit children because it is psychologically less damaging to have no contact with one parent than shuttle between two households. However there is a growing movement, organized mostly by non-custodial fathers, to \u201creform\u201d Japanese family law and popularize a joint custody option. This presentation focuses on both people who experienced a \u201cclean break\u201d divorce and those who are increasingly calling that disconnection into question. I argue that although there are no requirements for shared custody, a substantial minority of families sustain de facto joint custody. Demonstrating contested, shifting ideals of familial bonds, these attempts to share custody highlight desires to redress the disconnection divorce produces and to create connected families, even when they bring legal risks.\nAllison Alexy\u00a0is an assistant professor in the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures and Department of Women\u2019s Studies at the University of Michigan.

In humans, these behaviors are both socially and historically shaped, but are also contingent upon many situational influences, including individual choices. I will explore the sex/gender dynamics informing the design and embodiment of artificial intelligence (AI) and robots, especially humanoids. In Japan, PM Abe is a leading promoter of the robotization of the labor force, including child- and elder-care, and has argued that robots will save the Japanese economy and liberate (married) women.

Despite her remarkable contributions toward modernizing the tradition, she is absent in the scholarship of Korean Buddhism. In this talk, I will draw on the known bits and pieces of information on Ch\u2019\u014fn to make a case that she played a seminal role in the incipient stage of modern Korean Buddhism. Ch\u2019\u014fn drew on a wide network of relationships both inside and outside the court to help establish the first modern institution of Korean Buddhism, build the first modern temple in central Seoul, and open the first modern Buddhist clinic in Korea. This article seeks to restore Ch\u2019\u014fn\u2019s centrality as a Buddhist modernizer, thereby ultimately bringing balance to a largely monastic-centered and nationalist history and lengthening the lineage of lay female leadership in the transformation of Korean Buddhism in the beginning of the twentieth century.\n", "endtime": "01:00 PM", "event_id": "", "event_index": 445, "location": "", "owner": "Center for East Asian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "Korean Studies Colloquium \"Restoring Buddhism to Seoul: Court Lady Ch\u2019\u014fn\u2019s Influence in Modernizing Korean Buddhism\"", "url": "https://ceas.sas.upenn.edu/events/korean-studies-colloquium-restoring-buddhism-seoul-court-lady-ch%E2%80%99%C5%8Fn%E2%80%99s-influence-modernizing", "suggest_candidates": ["East Asian Studies", "Modernizing Korean Buddhism", "Korean Buddhist", "Chos\u014fn", "Korean Buddhism"]},

They grew especially alarmed at the growing power the government was giving to psychiatrists to oversee the psychological wellbeing of Americans. Using the state\u2019s police powers, they feared, liberals would soon declare anti-communists and other conservatives mentally ill and banish them to mental institutions. Two events in the 1950s brought these anxieties to a fever pitch: the involuntary confinement of Vermont anti-communist activist Lucille Miller to a federal psychiatric hospital and federal legislation to fund the construction of a mental hospital in the Alaska territory.\n  In their campaigns to free Miller and stop the construction of what they believed would be an Alaskan gulag, these activists turned to the law. They argued that the Constitution safeguarded a vision of liberty as the absence of unwanted government intrusions into an individual\u2019s life. While these ultraconservative activists were dismissed as crackpots, many of their critics also felt a sense of diminished autonomy in the postwar world. In subsequent decades, they too would grow wary of government paternalism and embrace, for various reasons, a more libertarian understanding of rights. This idea of rights would eclipse an alternative vision of them as a tool for pursuing collective, egalitarian ends. To our growing body of explanations about how communitarian possibilities for civil rights and civil liberties were \u201clost\u201d or \u201ctamed\u201d in the middle of the twentieth century, we might add anxieties about the fragility of the individual mind, which the cultural life of the Cold War drove to unprecedented levels.", "endtime": "1:20 PM", "event_id": "60767", "event_index": 457, "location": "Faculty Lounge", "owner": "Penn Law School", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "summary": "", "title": "Legal History Workshop: Daniel LaChance, Emory University", "url": "https://www.law.upenn.edu/newsevents/calendar.php#event_id/60767/view/event", "suggest_candidates": ["Penn Law School", "Daniel LaChance", "Emory University", "Miller", "the Radical Right", "Lucille Miller"]},

Since the early nineteenth century, Americans opposed the immigration of poor foreign workers who would degrade the dignity of labor and lower American wage standards. The opposition to immigrant labor became especially strong in the case of contract workers. In 1885, American workers\u2019 antipathy to \u201calien contract labor\u201d resulted in the passage of the federal Foran Act to ban the landing of foreign contract workers and deport those already in the United States back to their countries of origin. This project examines how hostility toward contract labor migration influenced American immigration law and how the alien contract labor law in turn affected immigrant workers.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  The paper traces the intellectual and legal genealogy of alien contract labor law by surveying the antebellum roots of opposition to imported labor in the United States. While labor radicalism in the late nineteenth century played a crucial role in the introduction of the Foran Act, the federal law was built upon earlier discourses on servile labor and the economic impact on Americans of immigration of certain kinds. In particular, the paper identifies the following four issues in antebellum America as the ideological and legal origins of the alien contract labor law: 1) Free Soilism, 2) \u201cpauper labor\u201d discourse, 3) assisted emigration, and 4) coolieism. The analysis in this paper is not intended to provide new evidence or revise historiography on these topics. Instead, the paper aims to demonstrate how the antebellum debates over the four issues collectively, if not exclusively, laid the foundations for the federal alien contract labor law, placing it in the broader framework of immigration politics beyond the labor conflict in the late nineteenth century.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Hidetaka Hirota is a non-tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Institute for Advanced Study at Waseda University in Japan.

The rapidly rising divorce rate created a widespread crisis among women who had relied on their husbands for economic support and access to social insurance benefits such as Social Security and health insurance. In reponse, a now-forgotten strand of the 1970s feminist movement, which I call \u201cthe feminist divorce reform movement,\u201d emerged and organized itself around securing women\u2019s place in the United States\u2019 marriage-based insurance system. This paper, part of a larger project on this movement, examines divorce\u2019s decreasing political salience as more and more women entered the permanent workforce. In the 1970s, one-third of married American women were in the paid labor force. By 1985 that number had shot up. Even women with young children were now as likely to be found in the workforce as at home: around 50 percent of mothers with children under three and roughly 70 percent of mothers with children over six were in the labor force.

More specifically, the paper highlights the possible impact of the period of papal interdict (c. 1208 \u2013 1214), imposed by Pope Innocent III in response to King John\u2019s intransigence over the appointment of a new archbishop of Canterbury, during this transitional period in criminal procedure. It argues that the interdict, with its suspension of liturgies, might have forced experimentation with alternative means of reaching verdicts in felony cases. The paper also suggests that juries might have been involved in the issuance of ordeal verdicts in the late ordeal period in England, in which case the shift from trial by ordeal to trial by jury may be less a moment of rupture than a transition from one form of trial using juries to another, albeit a trial form more starkly desacralized after 1215. It is the author\u2019s hope that the paper will serve as a starting point for further research, not a decisive answer to the questions it raises, including whether England\u2019s rapid adoption of final jury verdicts may owe something to the tussle between King John and a particularly imperial and imperious pope.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Elizabeth Papp Kamali is an Assistant Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, where she teaches Criminal Law, English Legal History, Medieval English Law, and a seminar on Mind and Criminal Responsibility.\u00a0 She is a faculty member of Harvard\u2019s Standing Committee on Medieval Studies.\u00a0 Her research focuses on the medieval English common law and the history of criminal law, with a particular interest in the early criminal trial jury.\u00a0 Her current projects include studies of the role of criminal intent in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century English felony cases, medieval understandings of anger\u2019s operation in felony adjudication, conflict between urban customary law and the English common law in the early fourteenth century, and the influence of Roman law on the early development of the common law.\u00a0 Recent publications include \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Daughter of Hell Fire: Anger\u2019s Role in Medieval English Felony Cases\u201d (Law and History Review, 2017) and \u201cLaw and Equity in a Medieval English Manor Court\u201d (in Texts and Contexts in Legal History: Essays in Honor of Charles Donahue, 2016).", "endtime": "1:15 PM", "event_id": "55474", "event_index": 469, "location": "Faculty Lounge", "owner": "Penn Law School", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "summary": "Workshop open to faculty and invited guests", "title": "Legal History Consortium Workshop: Elizabeth Kamali", "url": "https://www.law.upenn.edu/newsevents/calendar.php#event_id/55474/view/event", "suggest_candidates": ["Penn Law School", "Elizabeth Kamali", "Elizabeth Papp Kamali", "Law", "Harvard Law School", "York", "Pope Innocent III", "John\u2019s", "Canterbury", "John", "Felony Cases\u201d", "Law and History Review", "Contexts"]},

Here I will address marine external fertilization and comment on recent work on mammals. I will show experiments that substantiate that sea urchin sperms exhibit chemotaxis as they swim towards the ovum. They are guided by flagellum internal [Ca2+] concentration fluctuations triggered by the binding of chemicals from the oocyte surroundings. Based on experiment, I present a family of logical regulatory networks for the [Ca2+] fluctuation signaling-pathway that reproduce previously observed electrophysiological behaviors and provide predictions, which have been confirmed with new experiments. These studies give insight on the operation of drugs that control sperm navigation. In this systems biology approach, global properties of the [Ca2+] discrete regulatory network dynamics such as: stability, redundancy, degeneracy, chaoticity and criticality can be determined. Our models operate near a critical dynamical regime, where robustness and evolvablity coexist. This regime is preserved under a class of strong perturbations. Based on global dynamics considerations, we have implemented a network node-reduction method. The coincidence of this reduced network with our bottom-up step-by-step, continuous differential equation modeling is reassuring. For the case of mammals our research has centered on the understanding of capacitation and acrosomal reaction. The first is a process by means of which roughly one third of the spermatozoa acquire the \u201ccapacity\u201d to fertilize; the second enables the spermatozoa to penetrate the egg\u00b4s surrounding zona pellucida.

Growing local correlations in the dynamics of the equilibrium liquid or the existence of a dynamical phase transition below the glass transition temperature have been hypothesized as potential origins for this phenomenon. However, it is extremely difficult to experimentally distinguish between such theoretical models.\nFree surfaces and interfaces can affect properties of glassy systems over length scales that can be much longer than the intermolecular interaction potential. For example, we have recently demonstrated that the dynamics of the glass surface can be as much as 8 decades faster than the bulk dynamics, resulting in an apparent glass to liquid transition in molecular glass films as thick as 30 nm. This strong perturbation allows us to experimentally explore the manifestations of these theoretical models and explore the existence of dynamical transitions in the bulk glass.

The vast journey of blue moves from Hebrew ritual uses of snail pigments to the chemistry and economics of blue jean dyes.\nAmerican chemist Roald Hoffmann is widely known for using quantum mechanics to help reveal the mechanisms of chemical reactions. He was born Roald Safran in 1937 in a small Polish town that is now part of the Ukraine. Hoffmann's father was a civil engineer familiar with the local infrastructure, which made him of value to the Nazis. For a while the family was allowed to remain in its own home, but was later relocated to a labor camp, where many of the Nazi guards could be bribed. After being paid off, the guards allowed 5-year-old Roald, his mother, two aunts, and an uncle to escape in early 1943. A Ukrainian couple hid them in the attic and storeroom of a nearby schoolhouse where the husband taught. Hoffmann's father remained behind in the camp, where he was tortured and killed by the Nazis in June 1943 for his involvement in a plot to arm camp prisoners.After the war ended, Hoffmann and his mother relocated to New York, where he later won a Westinghouse science scholarship to Columbia University, earning his BA there. He took his doctorate in chemistry from Harvard and in 1965 began teaching chemistry at Cornell, where he is now Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters Emeritus. Since 2002, Hoffmann has hosted a monthly cabaret called \"Entertaining Science\" at Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9 in Greenwich Village.In 1963 Hoffmann introduced the extended H\u00fcckel method, a molecular orbital theory that allows calculation of the electronic structure of molecules. In 1965, in collaboration with Nobel laureate Robert Burns Woodward, he introduced the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a method for exploring the electronic structure of transition states and intermediates in organic reactions. Hoffmann and Japanese chemist Kenichi Fukui shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1981 for their theories, developed independently, concerning the course of chemical reactions (Woodward had died two years earlier and thus was ineligible).Hoffmann is also a published poet, playwright, and essayist. His poems appear in several collections: The Metamict State (1987), Gaps and Verges (1990), Memory Effects (1999), and Soliton (2002). In addition, he is a philosopher of science who has made significant contributions to our conceptual, historical, and normative understanding of chemistry. Many of his philosophical essays have been collected in Roald Hoffman on the Philosophy, Art, and Science of Chemistry by Jeffrey Kovac and Michael Weisberg, eds.

How do their patterns provide protective camouflage in tropical rain forests? How is nanotechnology using the waterproofing properties of butterfly colors to fabricate energy-efficient materials for buildings? In this panel discussion, Penn researchers discuss how their scientific and technological work imitates nature.\nUsing holographic lithography, Shu Yang and her Penn research team recently developed a material that mimics the iridescent and water-resistant qualities of butterfly wings. Applying this innovation, they developed a superhydrophobic coating that can be sprayed onto any surface. The solution contains nanoscopic particles that add a nearly invisible layer of roughness to a surface. Among other things, this highly water resistant coating is now being used on solar panels to keep them drier, cleaner and more efficient.\nIn 2004, Shu Yang was named one of the World's Top 100 Innovators Under 35 by MIT Technology Review. In 2006, she received the prestigious Faculty Early Career Development Award from the National Science Foundation.

He is also president of the Guanacaste Dry Forest Conservation Fund (GDFCF), the US-based NGO for ACG.\nHe and his wife, Winnie Hallwachs, are currently working to further the CBOL (Consortium for the Barcode of Life) and iBOL (International Barcode of Life) efforts to DNA barcode all species of the world for their identification and species discovery by anyone anywhere at any time. Janzen is also an international authority on the taxonomy and biology of tropical caterpillars, and is a member of the US and the Costa Rican National Academy of Sciences, and recipient of the Crafoord Prize (1984), the Kyoto Prize (1997), and BBVA Prize (2012).\nJohn Tresch is an historian of science and technology. Trained in anthropology and philosophy, his work explores the diversity of the sciences, especially in their interactions with other cultural formations. He focuses on connections between cosmology, experience, social order, and ritual; changing methods, instruments, and disciplinary arrangements in the sciences, arts, and media; and shifting definitions of the rational and real.\nHis book\u00a0The Romantic Machine,\u00a0which is set in France before the revolution of 1848, examines intersections between romanticism, science, industry, and utopian politics. It won the 2013 History of Science Society's Pfizer Award for Outstanding Book and was named one of the Best Books of 2012 by The New Museum in New York. His forthcoming book, Poe's Machinery: Twisted Visions, Incredible Facts, and the Forging of US Science, shows Edgar Allan Poe's technical obsessions in the light of the efforts of scientists to institute authority over knowledge. Tresch is also working on the study of cosmograms as a tool for comparative cosmology, notably in the Anthropocene and the digital age; as well as a study of contemporary neuroscience in its encounters with contemplative practices.\nTresch has held fellowships at Columbia's Society of Fellows in the Humanities, Northwestern, the University of Chicago, the Max Planck Institute for History of Science, the Huntington Library, and the Cullman Center at the New York Public Library.", "endtime": "6:30pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 510, "location": "Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "Beautiful Science", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/beautiful-science", "suggest_candidates": ["Penn Museum", "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "Penn", "Shu Yang", "World", "MIT Technology Review", "the National Science Foundation", "Yang", "Daniel Janzen", "Area de Conservacion Guanacaste", "ACG", "GDFCF", "NGO", "Winnie Hallwachs", "International Barcode of Life"]},

Moderated by Penn urban design professor Amy Hillier, the event will feature site-specific mural projects from around the city.Jane Golden, as the driving force behind the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program, is a true agent of social change, a Philadelphia phenom. Conceived as an anti-graffiti program in 1984, the Mural Arts Program has under Golden's leadership produced over 3600 landmark works of public art in nearly every neighborhood throughout the city. What do these murals embody? So much\u2014about what transforms places, people, communities, and institutions. Read the program's mission statement: \"We believe art ignites change.\" Live its golden rule: \"When we create art with each other and for each other, the force of life can triumph.\" And celebrate its \"Palette of Core Values.\" Do these things, and you will know why Jane Golden has been honored with so many awards, among them the Philadelphia Award, the Hepburn Medal, the 2012 Governor's Award for Innovation in the Arts, and the Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania Award.Betsy Casa\u00f1as is a studio and public mural artist, a community activist, and an educator who was born and raised in the heart of \"The Badlands\" of North Philadelphia's barrio. She received her BFA from Moore College of Art and Design, and has worked in the Latino community since 1994. Casa\u00f1as has exhibited her work in various solo and group exhibits and has designed over 40 public murals and mosaics nationally and internationally. In 2007 she cofounded The Semilla Arts, a grassroots initiative that uses collaborative art as a means of empowering people and communities in underserved areas. In 2010 she opened \"A Seed of Diamond Gallery,\" a community space where artists of different cultural background gather to tell their stories through spoken word, music, and visual arts.Ernel Martinez was inspired to become a mural artist while a PennDesign student in Jane Golden's class on public art at the University of Pennsylvania, where one of his mentors was Terry Adkins. Martinez received his MFA from Penn in 2004 and has since worked on over 25 murals across Philadelphia, including A Place to Call Home, The Color of Your Voice.Amy Hillier holds joint faculty appointments in Penn's School of Design and School of Social Policy and Practice, where she teaches and studies the impact of the built environment on public health and welfare\u2014in particular, the impact to disadvantaged communities of more limited access to services and resources.

Value with respect to color can mean the relative lightness or darkness of a hue, but can also mean aesthetic merit, political importance, moral acceptability, or material worth. The question of color's values is also fundamentally a question of sensory perception, constructed at the level of the individual synapse as well as the cultural collective. We want to consider the descriptive language of color\u2014how we evoke color with and/or through value-laden words or actions, how we assign qualities or quantities to different colors, how color is experienced through taste or touch as well as sight.Four distinguished scholars - Richard Doyle, Torkwase Dyson, Nicole Fleetwood, and Mohan Matthen - will explore the values of color from a variety of perspectives. How and why do we classify and assign values (moral, economic, social, epistemic) to particular colors, even 'people of color,' or material gradations, from light to dark? How does color function in a modern economy? What is its role in making subjectivity legible through its performance? How does color function as nonverbal communication that is affectively felt? To what degree is color a 'natural' or physical property and in what ways is it a rhetorical or cultural construction? And, how do institutions assign value to color?\u00a0\nSCHEDULE10:00-10:15am | WelcomeElizabeth Della Zazzera, Graduate Humanities Forum ChairNese Devenot, GHF Mellon Fellow\n10:15am-12:30pm | Panel DiscussionModerators: Jeannie Kenmotsu and Ting Fung Ho, GHF Mellon FellowsCommentators: Louise Daoust and Alan Niles, GHF Mellon Fellows\nRichard Doyle\nBy the Way, Which One's Pink?: On the Minimal Conditions for a Transmission of Philip K.

He directs the Laboratory for Perception and Action at the Baylor College of Medicine, whose goal is to understand how the brain constructs perception, how different brains do so differently, and how this matters for society. He also founded and directs Baylor's Initiative on Neuroscience and Law, which studies how new discoveries in neuroscience should navigate the way we make laws, punish criminals, and develop rehabilitation. And, he founded and is chief scientific officer for BrainCheck, a company that uses interactive testing on portable tablets to measure brain function, which schools are using to rapidly measure concussions at the sidelines.\nIn 2011, Eagleman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and that same year won the Eric Hoffer Book Award Montaigne Medal for his book Wednesday is Indigo Blue: Discovering the Brain of Synesthesia, coauthored with Richard Cytowic. In 2012 he was named Science Educator of the Year by the Society for Neuroscience, and was featured as one of the year's Brightest Idea Guys by Italy's Style Magazine. In 2014, he received the John J. McGovern Award for Excellence in Biomedical Education from the American Medical Writers' Association.\nOne of his latest books, Livewired: How the Brain Rewrites its Own Circuitry, is due in spring 2015 (Doubleday Canada). Also in Fall 2015, Eagleman will host the new PBS science series, \"The Brain with Dr. David Eagleman.\"\nFrom the Eagleman Laboratory website, in his own words:\"Public understanding of science is a passion of mine, and to that end I have written for the New York Times, Discover Magazine, Atlantic, The Week, Slate, Wired, New Scientist, and others.

Now that the audience is assembled\u202f(Duke, 2018) is a prose poem that describes a fictional musical performance during which an unnamed musician improvises the construction of a series of invented instruments before an audience that is alternately contemplative, participatory, disputatious, and asleep. Both a work of literature and a study of music,\u202fNow that the audience is assembled\u202fexplores the categories of improvised music, solo performance, text scores, instrument building, aesthetic deskilling and reskilling, and the odd fate of the composer in experimental music. Grubbs\u2019s forthcoming The Voice in the Headphones (Duke, 2020) centers on the culture of the recording studio, presenting in intricate, prismatic detail one marathon day in a recording studio over the course of which an unnamed musician struggles to complete a film soundtrack. The Voice in the Headphones arrives at a moment in which the commercial recording studio shades into oblivion and is replaced by digital work environments; it draws upon Grubbs\u2019s own history of several decades as a recording artist, and its location could be described as every studio in which he has set foot. The experience of working in the recording studio is in large part the experience of the language that surrounds and infuses the world of the studio\u2014and that language is the material of this poem.\n\nAbout David Grubbs\n\nDavid Grubbs is Professor of Music at Brooklyn College and The Graduate Center, CUNY.\u00a0 At Brooklyn College he also teaches in the MFA programs in Performance and Interactive Media Arts (PIMA) and Creative Writing.\u00a0 He is the author of Now that the audience is assembled and Records Ruin the Landscape: John Cage, the Sixties, and Sound Recording\u00a0(both Duke University Press)and, with Anthony McCall, Simultaneous Soloists (Pioneer Works Press).\u00a0 In the spring of 2020, Duke University Press will publish The Voice in the Headphones, Grubbs\u2019s second experiment in music writing in the form of a book-length poem.\n\nGrubbs has released fourteen solo albums and appeared on more than 190 releases; his most recent solo recording is Creep Mission (Blue Chopsticks, 2017).

As energy analysts note, the frenetic pace and vast scale of the fracking boom constitutes an \u201cenergy revolution\u201d that is transforming geopolitics and the world economy. Yet the \u201cbig picture\u201d overlooks how personal fracking is. The U.S. is the only country in the world where private property rights extend to all subsurface minerals; the fracking boom depends on the millions of people residing over shale deposits privately agreeing to lease their land\u2019s subsurface mineral rights to petroleum companies. This means that this momentous and far-reaching decision about the planet\u2014to frack or not to frack\u2014is largely a series of individual choices rather than the result of collective deliberation. Many of the spillover effects of fracking are felt close to home: one\u2019s decision to lease may impact neighbors\u2019 air, water, or property. While resource dilemmas are usually experienced in the abstract (e.g., lab simulations, or considering future generations), shale communities must confront the conflict between self-interest and the commonwealth at the fencepost, the general store, and town halls. Based on ethnographic research in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, Jerolmack will discuss how, on the one hand, support for land leasing and fracking cannot be reduced to self-interest and how, on the other hand, the legally protected freedom to exploit one\u2019s mineral rights had the ironic effect of eroding the freedom of others--their right to be left alone, and their sovereignty over their estate. These findings offer lessons for overcoming the greatest collective action problem of all: climate change.\nAbout the Speaker\nColin Jerolmack is an associate professor of Sociology and Environmental Studies at NYU, where he is also the chair of the Environmental Studies Department. He received his Ph.D. in sociology from the City University of New York in 2009; before arriving at NYU, he was a Robert Wood Johnson Scholar in Health Policy at Harvard. Jerolmack's first book, The Global Pigeon (University of Chicago Press), is\u00a0a comparative ethnography of how relations with animals shape our experience of urban life. He is currently completing his next book, Up to Heaven and Down to Hell: Fracking, Freedom, and Community in an American Town (Princeton University Press), on which today's talk is based.

In cities like New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Atlanta, community media operations \u2014 also commonly referred to in the U.S. as PEG (public, educational, and government access cable television) \u2014 came to life amid the emergence of consumer video recording technology and cable television in the late 1960s. However, in Philadelphia, it took a 27-year activist-led fight to realize PhillyCAM \u2014 a refreshed vision of public access television and community radio harmoniously combined in one organization.\n\"Community Media in a Digital Age\" is a conversation with community activist DeeDee Halleck on truth-telling and trust building through communal media making practices. The discussion will be led by Annenberg School doctoral student Antoine Haywood, and will focus on how citizens continue to use community television and radio to communicate local identity, share authentic perspectives, and disrupt hegemonic narratives disseminated by mainstream media. There will be an emphasis on how democratic media-making organizations can facilitate trust building and truth-telling to maintain their relevance during an era defined by eroding local news ecosystems, dated public interest media policies, and unregulated digital platforms and infrastructures.\nThe event is free and open to the public, and has been organized by the Media, Inequality & Change Center at the Annenberg School, Slought, Scribe Video Center, and PhillyCAM to celebrate community media in Philadelphia.

Alexander L. Fattal shows how the market has become one of the principal grounds on which counterinsurgency warfare is waged and postconflict futures are imagined in Colombia. This layered case study illuminates a larger phenomenon: the convergence of marketing and militarism in the twenty-first century. Taking a global view of information warfare,\u00a0Guerrilla Marketing\u00a0combines archival research and\u00a0extensive fieldwork not just with the Colombian Ministry of Defense and former rebel communities, but also with political exiles in Sweden and peace negotiators in Havana. Throughout, Fattal deftly intertwines insights into the modern surveillance state, peace and conflict studies, and humanitarian interventions, on one hand, with critical engagements with marketing, consumer culture, and late capitalism on the other. The result is a powerful analysis of the intersection of conflict and consumerism in a world where governance is increasingly structured by brand ideology and wars sold as humanitarian interventions.\n\u00a0\nFull of rich, unforgettable ethnographic stories,\u00a0Guerrilla Marketing\u00a0is a stunning and troubling analysis of the mediation of global conflict.\n\nNew Yorker\n\n\"A sobering book on how armies burnish their brands. . . a detailed, eye-opening investigation.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nReVista\n\n\"Guerrilla Marketing\u00a0is a fascinating book that illustrates how the government\u2019s turn to marketing blurred the boundaries between war and peace by penetrating deep into the emotional space of insurgents and their families. It is a well-written account that intersperses analytic chapters with the author\u2019s riveting interviews with FARC insurgents, which offer a view into how the rebels understand what has happened to themand sidesteps PAHD propaganda. The book should be read by anyone trying to understand contemporary Colombian society.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nJon Lee Anderson, author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life\n\n\u201cGuerrilla Marketing\u00a0is a fascinating examination of how commercial-style branding has been deployed by both rebels and the state in Colombia's civil war. Fattal deserves high praise for his extraordinary research, carried out over many years in the edgy and borderless terrain of the war's periphery. His insights are lucid and the stories he tells are haunting. This book is a must-read for scholars of modern conflict, journalists, and diplomats.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAbout the Speaker\nAlexander L.

This dystopian narrative has come to dominate political agendas across the globe. To save democracy \u2014 a number of voices argue \u2014 radical measures are needed. In this talk, Johan Farkas critically examines post-truth discourses, honing in on both the contemporary threats posed by disguised propaganda on social media and the risks of advancing undemocratic solutions to solve them.\nThe first part of the talk dives into the rise and proliferation of disguised propaganda on social media, drawing on empirical cases such as the Internet Research Agency in Russia and fake Muslim Facebook pages in Denmark. While disguised propaganda is not a new phenomenon in itself, the technological architecture of digital platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, enables new forms of manipulation, tactically exploiting interfaces, algorithmic proliferation, and content moderation policies. This poses novel challenges for democracy.\nDisguised propaganda in digital media have caused scholars, journalists, and politicians to talk about a post-truth crisis in dire need of fixing. Indeed, for many, truth must be restored at all costs, as democracy is founded on evidence-based decision-making. The second part of the talk critically engages with these post-truth discourses and the solutions they contain. Engaging with critical political philosophy, Farkas highlights how these \"democratic imaginaries\" neglect how democracy has never been about truth, evidence and rationality alone. It is equally about the voice of the democratic people. By neglecting this cornerstone of the democratic tradition, post-truth discourses reproduce and strengthen a risky vision of democracy \u2014 one in which consensus and rationality dominate over civic voices and popular dispute. By doing so, contemporary post-truth discourses \u2014 and the solutions they contain \u2014 might end up deepening existing democratic problems.\nThe talk is based on Farkas\u2019 new book, Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy: Mapping the Politics of Falsehood, written with Jannick Schou and published by Routledge.\nAbout the Speaker\nJohan Farkas is a Ph.D. Fellow in Media and Communication Studies at Malm\u00f6 University in Sweden. His research engages with the intersection of digital media platforms, disinformation, politics, journalism, and democracy. Farkas has published on these topics in international journals such as New Media & Society, Social Media + Society, and Critical Discourse Studies. In September 2019, his debut book, Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy: Mapping the Politics of Falsehood (with Jannick Schou) was published by Routledge.

The Rape Documentary and the 2019 publication of the anthology Love WITH Accountability: Digging Up the Roots of Child Sexual Abuse and host a national, intergenerational forum to co-envision a society without violence.\nThere isn\u2019t a more significant time to lift the courageous, intergenerational, diasporic Black voices in NO! The Rape Documentary and Love WITH Accountability: Digging Up the Roots of Child Sexual Abuse anthology than now. Fall 2019 will mark both the 25th anniversary of the first pre-production meeting for the internationally acclaimed documentary film and the forthcoming publication of the anthology. Each of these works are groundbreaking, prevention resources that unwaveringly center diasporic Black survivors of adult rape and child sexual abuse. To commemorate the convergence of these milestones, Aishah Shahidah Simmons, the award-winning director of the film, and the editor of the anthology, is partnering with the University of Pennsylvania, the Just Beginnings Collaborative, Feminist and Gender Studies Department at Colorado College, Scribe Video Center, and the African American Museum of Philadelphia, to host #FromNO2Love: Black Feminist Centered Forum on Disrupting Sexual Violence in Philadelphia on October 31 & November 1. This gathering will lift the long-term and new survivor-led work that addresses, disrupts, and works to humanely end child sexual abuse and adult rape in marginalized communities.\nConfirmed #FromNO2Love attendees/presenters (alphabetical order): Liz S.

If infrastructure conditions how information, people, and things circulate, then what might the practices of concealment tell us about the political stakes of circulation, and about the nature of our infrastructural surround? What kinds of visual forms emerge in global media events in which concealment is crucial part, sometimes even the condition of possibility for targetable people and equipment to stay on air. This colloquium examines these contradictions in the context of Lebanon, where infrastructural disrepair and breakdown parallel political impasses and fragmentation. It takes the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year as its case study. Based on fieldwork and visual analysis, El-Hibri examines how concealment structures phenomena ranging from live satellite news broadcasts, drone-cam footage, signal jamming and hacking, and online guerilla video from the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year. He shows how televisual liveness in this event \u2014 that new-again promise to see things faraway as they happen \u2014 demonstrates how the geopolitics of simultaneity has transformed in the contemporary moment.\nAbout the Speaker\nHatim El-Hibri is a\u00a0Faculty Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication and an\u00a0Assistant Professor of Film and Media at George Mason University. He earned his Ph.D in Media, Culture, and Communication from New York University, and previously was a member of the Media Studies Program at the American University of Beirut. His research and teaching interests are global and Arab media and communication, visual culture studies, media infrastructure, and urban studies.

In his book,\u00a0The Palestinian Idea, Greg Burris argues that it is precisely through film and media that hope can occasionally emerge amidst hopelessness, emancipation amidst oppression, freedom amidst apartheid. The author employs the work of Edward W. Said, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, and Cedric J. Robinson in order to locate Palestinian utopia in the heart of the Zionist present. He analyzes the films of prominent directors Annemarie Jacir (Salt of This Sea,\u00a0When I Saw You) and Hany Abu-Assad (Paradise Now) to investigate the emergence and formation of Palestinian identity. Looking at Mais Darwazah\u2019s documentary\u00a0My Love Awaits Me by the Sea, Burris considers the counterhistories that make up the Palestinian experience\u2014stories and memories that have otherwise been obscured or denied. He also examines Palestinian (in)visibility in the global media landscape, and how issues of Black-Palestinian transnational solidarity are illustrated through social media, staged news spectacles, and hip hop music.\u00a0\n\"A deeply felt, brilliantly conceived, meticulously crafted book,\u00a0The Palestinian Idea\u00a0breaks new ground in how we understand vision, space, and identity.

Situating Palestine in relation to various global revolutionary movements and animating Palestine's own revolutionary identity, Burris has managed the rare feat of producing scholarship that is both timeless and topical. By so thoroughly and imaginatively exploring the idea of Palestine, he illuminates exactly how real Palestine is.\" \u2014Steven Salaita, author of\u00a0Israel's Dead Soul\nAbout the Speaker\nGreg Burris is a film and cultural theorist whose work focuses on race, media, and emancipatory politics.

Through a consideration of the television set\u2019s intertwining with devices ranging from VCRs to set-top boxes and optical-fiber cables, Chirumamilla exposes new veins of analysis through which we might understand both the inter-media history within which television in South India is embedded and the kinds of mediated futures that television\u2019s material transformations portend.\n\u00a0\nFollowing an overview of her larger project, which utilizes both ethnographic research and close textual analysis of newspapers, enthusiast magazines, and policy documents, Chirumamilla will turn her focus to the objects of the television set, the videotape, and the VCR. How does looking at these objects in concert with each other change our imagining of the historical trajectory of television in South India? She will argue that the television set\u2019s entanglement with videotapes and the VCR is illustrative of the contentious, close relationship between the commercial cinema industry and television\u2019s growing presence within the lives of Indian media consumers; an entanglement that has so far gone understudied and might offer us new ways to think about how we theorize the pasts and futures of media technologies.\n\u00a0\n\nAbout the Speaker\nPadma Chirumamilla\u00a0is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication. Her work examines how media infrastructures shape and are shaped by everyday cultural life and labor in postcolonial South India and the broader Global South. Her dissertation investigates how the television \u2014 both the physical object and the broader media entity \u2014 were integrated into the daily rhythms of viewers and media workers in small-town and rural regions in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, through venues like the repair shop and technologies likes the videotape and VCR. Through a combination of ethnographic and textually-based methods, Chirumamilla\u2019s research considers how the materiality of media shapes its absorption into the routines and rhythms of everyday life in the Global South. She is also interested in notions of technological futurity, and how the futuristic allure of digital technologies configures everyday encounters with media infrastructures in the Global South. Chirumamilla is a first-generation postsecondary scholar. She received her Ph.D. in Information Studies from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in the summer of 2019. She obtained an M.A. in South and Southeast Asian Studies from the University of California, Berkeley, and a B.A. in English Language and Literature from the University of Chicago.\u00a0\nLunch begins at 11:45.\u00a0Space is limited, RSVP to\u00a0marina.krikorian@asc.upenn.edu.", "endtime": "1:00pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 550, "location": "Location:\u00a03901 Walnut Street, 6th Floor", "owner": "Annenberg School of Communication", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "CARGC Colloquium: Padma Chirumamilla, Annenberg School", "url": "https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/events/cargc-colloquium-padma-chirumamilla", "suggest_candidates": ["Annenberg School of Communication", "Padma Chirumamilla", "Chirumamilla", "a Postdoctoral Fellow", "Chirumamilla\u2019s", "Ph.D. in Information Studies", "the University of Michigan", "the University of Chicago", "RSVP"]},

These over-parametrized machine learning models, trained with rudimentary optimization algorithms on non-convex landscapes in millions of dimensions have defied attempts to put a sound theoretical footing beneath their impressive performance.This talk will shed light upon some of these mysteries. I will employ diverse ideas -- from thermodynamics and optimal transportation to partial differential equations, control theory and Bayesian inference -- and paint a picture of the training process of deep networks. Along the way, I will develop state-of-the-art algorithms for non-convex optimization. The goal of machine perception is not just to classify objects in images but instead, enable intelligent agents that can seamlessly interact with our physical world.

  {"date": "Oct 02 2019", "date_dt": "02-10-2019", "description": "Neutrinos are the most abundant type of fermion that we know exists, yet we do not understand basic properties of these particles like their masses. Since neutrinos are unaffected by strong and electromagnetic forces, they hardly interact with normal matter and we must construct enormous detectors to measure them at all.\u00a0\u00a0 Despite such challenges, these enigmatic particles have played a crucial role in the development of the universe as we know it. Much of our understanding of neutrinos comes from neutrino oscillation experiments, in which neutrinos created in one weak-interaction eigenstate change to another via a quantum mechanical interference effect. Future high-precision measurements of oscillation phenomena in detectors with Argon targets will yield the neutrino mass ordering and leptonic CP structure.

Growing local correlations in the dynamics of the equilibrium liquid or the existence of a dynamical phase transition below the glass transition temperature have been hypothesized as potential origins for this phenomenon. However, it is extremely difficult to experimentally distinguish between such theoretical models.\nFree surfaces and interfaces can affect properties of glassy systems over length scales that can be much longer than the intermolecular interaction potential. For example, we have recently demonstrated that the dynamics of the glass surface can be as much as 8 decades faster than the bulk dynamics, resulting in an apparent glass to liquid transition in molecular glass films as thick as 30 nm. This strong perturbation allows us to experimentally explore the manifestations of these theoretical models and explore the existence of dynamical transitions in the bulk glass. In this talk I will discuss the properties of thin films of polymeric and molecular glasses and discuss how these properties fit in the broader theoretical picture.", "endtime": "5:00pm", "event_id": "", "event_index": 769, "location": "", "owner": "Department of Physics and Astronomy", "speaker": "Zahra Fakhraai (University of Pennsylvania)", "starttime": "4:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "Condensed and Living Matter Seminar: Title: \"Understanding Glass Transition through Interfacial Properties\"", "url": "https://www.physics.upenn.edu/index.php/events/condensed-and-living-matter-seminar-title-understanding-glass-transition-through-interfacial", "suggest_candidates": ["Physics and Astronomy", "Zahra Fakhraai", "University of Pennsylvania", "Condensed"]},

In Fourier ptychographic microscopy, variable illumination patterns are used to collect multiple low-resolution images. These low-resolution images are then computationally combined to create an image with resolution exceeding that of any single image from the microscope. Due to the necessity of acquiring multiple low-resolution images, Fourier ptychographic microscopy has poor temporal resolution. Our aim is to improve temporal resolution in Fourier ptychographic microscopy, achieving single-shot imaging without sacrificing space-bandwidth product. We use physical preprocessing and example-based super-resolution to achieve this goal by trading off generality of the imaging approach.\nIn example-based super-resolution, the function relating low-resolution images to their high-resolution counterparts is learned from a given dataset. We take the additional step of optimizing the imaging hardware in order to collect more informative low-resolution images.

This difficulty stems from the intricate interplay between length scales spanning as much as 3-4 orders of magnitude, which has stymied our understanding of a truly important class of polymers; polyelectrolytes are widely used in applications ranging from food additives to paints, and most biopolymers (proteins, DNA, polysaccharides) are also polyelectrolytes. However, the complexity of charged polymers can be harnessed for molecular-level materials design. To demonstrate this, we study a class of polyelectrolyte materials known as complex coacervates. Complex coacervates are aqueous solutions composed of oppositely-charged polyelectrolytes and salt that undergo an associative phase separation process.\u00a0We use simulation and theory, along with close experimental collaboration, to demonstrate that coacervates are highly sensitive to precise charge patterning. We elucidate the key molecular features that play a large role in coacervate thermodynamics. Building upon these insights, we demonstrate how coacervate phase behavior can be strongly tuned via specific charge sequences. We will show how the physical principles governing the thermodynamics of sequence-defined polyelectrolytes provides the foundation to study coacervate-driven assembly on length scales ranging from monomer-level structure to block copolymer nano-phase separation.", "endtime": "4:00 PM", "event_id": "", "event_index": 797, "location": "Wu and Chen Auditorium (Room 101), Levine Hall,  3330 Walnut Street", "owner": "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CBE)", "speaker": "Charles Sing, PhD\nAssistant Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nCharles Sing is an Assistant Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The ability to rapidly transform a substrate from a hard, structural material to a soft, hydrogel structure over the course of a few tens of nanometers makes polymer brushes elegant materials for tailoring the biology-materials interface. Polymer brushes, because of their surface confinement, are typically stretched from the surface when compared to identical unattached polymer segments and confinement provides them with useful barrier properties.

Crayfish are inexpensive and easily maintained in the laboratory, and they have an accessible nervous system with large, identified neurons that link directly to behavior and can sustain many hours of experimental study. This allows for high precision and reproducibility and makes crayfish a suitable model not just for investigating neurobehavioral questions, but for developing and improving biomedical devices and tools. In the second part of my talk, I will illustrate two projects that are currently ongoing in collaboration with engineering colleagues at UMD. The first one aims to develop nanoparticles that wirelessly activate and record neural activity patterns using microwave signals. Preliminary data using individual neurons of the ex vivo crayfish nerve cord revealed that single action potentials can be robustly recorded by activating microwave signals in a nanoscale magnetic tunnel junction. The future goal of this project is to develop this technique for non-invasive monitoring and modulating of activity in brains of higher complexity. The second project interfaces the crayfish ex vivo ventral nerve cord and innervated hindgut with a multi-sensor 3D printed platform that contains cultured human gut cells and interchangeable colonies of microbiota. The physiological responses to serotonin release from cell cultures will be measured and quantified in crayfish neurons of the central and enteric nervous system and on corresponding hindgut motility with intracellular electrophysiology and motion tracking.

Atomistic modeling and atomic resolution imaging are contemporary tools under use to elucidate the memory phenomena. Likewise, from a practical point, electronic tattoos based on graphene have ushered a new material platform that has highly desirable practical attributes including optical transparency, mechanical imperceptibility, and is the thinnest conductive electrode sensor that can be integrated on skin for physiological measurements.

These limitations can be overcome using drop-based microfluidics in which picoliter-sized, water-in-oil emulsions serve as independent microreactors, allowing for the compartmentalization of microbes and high-throughput assaying at the single cell level. Here, drop-based microfluidics is used to interrogate the physiological heterogeneity of P. aeruginosa cells in a microbial population using a technique we name DropSOAC (Drop Stabilization On A Chip). The DropSOAC method stabilizes the position and volume of monodisperse water-in-oil drops with diameters <20 mm within a monolayer array on a microfluidic chip for 24 h. The stability of drops is maintained by soaking the device in a reservoir containing both water and oil in thermodynamic equilibrium. This ensures that phase equilibrium of the drop emulsion fluids within the porous PDMS material structure is maintained during drop incubation and imaging. Continuing this work, we aim to study the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance now observed in common bacterial strains to find effective treatments for persistent bacterial infections. This will be performed using a microfluidic chip that is capable of encapsulating in parallel, 96 barcoded assay samples in drops using fluorescent particles. Using a custom-built microscope that can read fluorescence from drops at rates of thousands per second, we demonstrate sorting for a particular barcode combination from our droplet library.

  {"date": "November 5 2019", "date_dt": "05-11-2019", "description": "Modern image sensors consist of systems of cascaded and bulky spherical optics for imaging with minimal aberrations. While these systems provide high-quality images, the improved functionality comes at the cost of increased size and weight. One route to reduce a system\u2019s complexity is via computational imaging, in which much of the aberration correction and functionality of the optical hardware is shifted to post-processing in the software realm. Alternatively, a designer could miniaturize the optics by replacing them with diffractive optical elements, which mimic the functionality of refractive systems in a more compact form factor. Metasurfaces are an extreme example of such diffractive elements, in which quasiperiodic arrays of resonant subwavelength optical antennas impart spatially-varying changes on a wavefront. While separately both computational imaging and metasurfaces are promising avenues toward simplifying optical systems, a synergistic combination of these fields can further enhance system performance and facilitate advanced capabilities. In this talk, I will present a method to combine these two techniques to perform full-color imaging across the whole visible spectrum [1].

  {"date": "November 8 2019", "date_dt": "08-11-2019", "description": "Abstract: Blood clot formation involves the coupled processes of platelet aggregation and coagulation, which are triggered when there is break in a blood vessel. Platelet aggregation is largely a physical process while coagulation is biochemical, consisting of a large network of reactions that culminate in the generation of the enzyme thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin, which polymerizes into fibers to form a stabilizing gel matrix in and around growing platelet aggregates. Thrombin also (re)binds directly to fibrin but this interaction, and its purpose, is not fully understood. Thrombin-fibrin binding is often described as two independent, single-step binding events, one high-affinity and one low-affinity, each through a different exosite on thrombin. However, kinetic schemes describing these single-step binding events with reported kinetic rate constants cannot explain experimentally-observed residency times of fibrin-bound thrombin. In this work, we study a bivalent, sequential-step binding scheme as an alternative to the high-affinity event, and in addition to the low-affinity one. We developed mathematical models for the single- and sequential-step schemes consisting of reaction-diffusion equations to compare to each other and to previously published experimental data. We then used Bayesian inference, in the form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo, to learn model parameter distributions from the experimental data. For the model to best fit the data, we needed an additional assumption that thrombin was irreversibly sequestered; we hypothesized that this could be due to thrombin becoming physically trapped within fibrin fibers as they formed. We also discuss how our model can be used to further probe scenarios dealing with thrombin allostery.", "endtime": "3:00 PM", "event_id": "", "event_index": 822, "location": "Towne 337", "owner": "Penn Institute for Computational Science (PICS)", "speaker": "Karin Leiderman\nAssociate Professor, Director of Graduate Studies, Department of Applied Math & Statistics, Colorado School of Mines\nKarin Leiderman is an Associate Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Colorado School of Mines.
