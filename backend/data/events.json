In this presentation, I argue that much of what we think we \u201cknow\u201d about racial profiling is wrong. Popular definitions of the term \u201cracial profiling\u201d are much too narrow or too vague, and, in this way, they are wrong. I contend prevailing thought on the causes of racial profiling as residing within individuals is deeply flawed and leads to interventions that will be ineffective such as implicit bias training. I demonstrate that racial profiling is not primarily a problem of biased cognitions; instead, racial profiling is caused by remediable structural factors that are beyond the control of individual officers patrolling American streets. These structural factors motivate police officers to take racially biased actions and facilitate racial profiling by providing legally defensible shields to conceal biased actions. The recognition of the true causes of racial profiling combined with technological innovations in policing lead to real-world solutions that could end racial profiling.\u00a0", "endtime": "01:00 PM", "event_index": 73, "location": "395 McNeil Building\u00a0\n3718 Locust Walk\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Dapartment of Criminology", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "title": "Criminology Colloquium Series: Ojmarrh Mitchell", "url": "https://crim.sas.upenn.edu/events/criminology-colloquium-series-ojmarrh-mitchell"},

In Euripides\u2019 Hippolytus, Phaedra avenges unrequited love for her stepson through an escalation of attacks on her own body, which ultimately leads to his demise. Phaedra responds to the shame she feels by committing suicide, and before that to the depression brought forth by unrequited love through starvation.

A long-standing problem with such regression analyses is the lack of effective diagnostic tools for validating model assumptions. The difficulty arises from the fact that an ordinal variable has discrete values that are labeled with, but not, numerical values. The values merely represent ordered categories. In this paper, we propose a surrogate approach to defining residuals for an ordinal outcome Y. The idea is to define a continuous variable S as a \u201csurrogate\u201d of Y and then obtain residuals based on S. For the general class of cumulative link regression models, we study the residual\u2019s theoretical and graphical properties. We show that the residual has null properties similar to those of the common residuals for continuous outcomes. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the residual has power to detect misspecification with respect to 1) mean structures; 2) link functions; 3) heteroscedasticity; 4) proportionality; and 5) mixed populations. The proposed residual also enables us to develop numeric measures for goodness-of-fit using classical distance notions. Our results suggest that compared to a previously defined residual, our residual can reveal deeper insights into model diagnostics. We stress that this work focuses on residual analysis, rather than hypothesis testing. The latter has limited utility as it only provides a single p-value, whereas our residual can reveal what components of the model are mis specified and advise how to make improvements.\n\n\n  This is a joint work with Dungang Liu, University of Cincinnati Lindner College of Business.", "endtime": " 4:30pm", "event_index": 256, "location": "701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "3:30pm ", "title": "Biostatistics Seminar Series - Heping Zhang, PhD", "url": "http://events.med.upenn.edu/cceb/#!view/event/event_id/710452"},

Her research focuses on the impact of health behaviors and modifiable risk factors in the development and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its complications, as well as addressing implementation gaps of evidence-based care in CKD. She has contributed to the growing evidence base that seeks to prioritize behavior recommendations for management of CKD as well as assessing barriers to healthy behavior engagement. She has conducted studies that have identified high levels of substandard health behavior engagement among adults with CKD and phenotypes of behavior engagement that associate with clinical outcomes in this population. Her present work includes assessing for real-time barriers to self-management health behaviors by interviewing patients with CKD and developing a patient-centered behavioral intervention that leverages mobile health technology to increase engagement in healthy behaviors. She will conduct its feasibility in a clinical trial. Dr. Schrauben is moving into the area of implementation science in order to address implementation gaps in evidence-based CKD care. Her future work aims to guide the development of innovative strategies to improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes in CKD.\n\n\nDr. Schrauben received her undergraduate degree in Human Biology with a specialization in Health Promotion from Michigan State University, and her medical degree from the College of Human Medicine at Michigan State University.

The workshop will convene at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for the Study of Contemporary China (CSCC) on Saturday, October 26, 2019. CHAIR brings young IR scholars together to share their latest research related to China, build a professional network, and strengthen the academic community that focuses on China and IR topics. CHAIR is also the ideal venue for participants to present revised versions of papers from APSA\u2019s summer 2019 meeting or rough drafts of papers for ISA\u2019s spring 2020 convention. CSCC will reimburse participants up to $500 for accommodation and travel expenses. The bulk of our applications tends to come from the United States and Canada, but we are open to applicants from around the world (those traveling from beyond the US East Coast may be eligible for additional funding).\nWe are looking for approximately ten participants to present works that are part of their dissertations or that they intend to publish. Paper topics span the entire range of the IR sub-field, and abstracts will be chosen based on their level of development, fit with other submissions as part of a cohesive session, and representation of diverse perspectives, methodologies, and institutions. The day-long workshop will consist of four thematically-organized sessions, each comprised of 2-3 presenters and a discussant. Each presenter need only offer a\u00a0brief\u00a0overview of the paper (~5 minutes), to be followed by the discussant\u2019s short, detailed comments on all the papers (~15 minutes). The majority of each session will be devoted to discussion open to all the participants.\u00a0We expect all participants to have read the papers before the workshop, so that workshop discussions on the day can be as fruitful and productive as possible.\nCHAIR offers an opportunity to build a community of young IR scholars who study China, and there will be ample time for socializing throughout the day. In addition to inter-session breaks, a catered lunch will be provided and, at the workshop\u2019s conclusion, we will be pleased to host dinner at a local restaurant for further conversation in a more casual setting. CHAIR thus represents an excellent opportunity for academic enrichment and professional networking. To see past workshop participants and papers, please visit our\u00a0Facebook page.

Wary of these dangers, China\u2019s national leaders have tried to forestall top-heavy urbanization. However, urban and regional development policies at the subnational level have not always followed suit.\u00a0China\u2019s Urban Champions\u00a0explores the development paths of different provinces and asks why policymakers in many cases favor big cities in a way that reinforces spatial inequalities rather than reducing\u00a0them.\nKyle Jaros combines in-depth case studies of Hunan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Jiangsu provinces with quantitative analysis to shed light on the political drivers of uneven development. Drawing on numerous Chinese-language written sources, including government documents and media reports, as well as a wealth of field interviews with officials, policy experts, urban planners, academics, and businesspeople, Jaros shows how provincial development strategies are shaped by both the horizontal relations of competition among different provinces and the vertical relations among different tiers of government. Metropolitan-oriented development strategies advance when lagging economic performance leads provincial leaders to fixate on boosting regional competitiveness, and when provincial governments have the political strength to impose their policy priorities over the objections of other\u00a0actors.\nRethinking the politics of spatial policy in an era of booming growth,\u00a0China\u2019s Urban Champions\u00a0highlights the key role of provincial units in determining the nation\u2019s metropolitan and regional development\u00a0trajectory.\nKyle A.

The 3-D printing process builds a three-dimensional object from a computer-aided design model by adding material, such as liquid resin or powder grains being fused together, layer by layer. This process is also known as additive manufacturing. In the early 1990s, 3-D printing techniques were considered suitable only for the production of functional or aesthetic prototypes. Fast-forward 30 years, and the speed, precision, repeatability, and material range have increased to the point that 3-D printing processes are now used in commercial industrial production. One of the key advantages of 3-D printing is the ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries directly without need for a mold. Thus the technology also lends itself to mass customization, where items, such as running shoes, can be customized to an individual\u2019s needs. Turner will discuss advances in the basic understanding of mechanical design of materials and components made via additive manufacturing. Liu will detail some of the state-of-the-art developments in additive manufacturing for the industrial scale; he has spent the last few years developing polymeric materials specifically for this application.

Italian merchants in 17th century Amsterdam\" \n(see abstract below)\nIt'll take place in Cherpack at 5:15 on Thursday Oct. 24. We hope to see many of you at this event.\n***\nABSTRACT\nEver since Genoese galleys had made their appearance at Bruges in the last quarter of the 13th century, communities of Italian long distance traders had been residing in the Low Countries. In the 16th century, most of them lived in Antwerp, then the commercial metropolis of the Low Countries. However, by the end of that century political and religious turmoil and climatological and demographic transformations had radically altered the trade patterns between the two regions. In 1585, Dutch rebels closed off Antwerp\u2019s access to the sea. Moreover, large parts of Italy became dependent upon the import of grains from the North. Therefore, by the 1590s many Italian merchants had left Antwerp. Subsequently, some of them, mostly Protestant Lucchese bankers, established themselves in Amsterdam.\nIn the final phases of the Thirty Years war a second wave of Italian migrants joined them. These new migrants mostly stemmed from humbler backgrounds. Moreover, they originated from provincial towns and not from commercial hubs such as Venice or Florence. Silvio Tensini, from Crema in Lombardy and his son in law Francesco Feroni, from Empoli in Tuscany were examples in point. In this lecture, I shall highlight the career of the latter.\nOriginally, Feroni concentrated on the import of Baltic grains to Italy, for which he established a network that stretched from Archangel in Russia, over Hamburg and Amsterdam to ports along the Tyrrhenian coast, such as Genoa, Livorno or Civitavecchia. Subsequently, he diversified his business and he started to import Spanish wools to the Netherlands and to export Dutch books, scientific instruments and works of art to Italy. Finally, he engaged in the triangular trade across the Atlantic in slaves and sugar. Moreover, Feroni acted as an information broker and an officious representative of the Medici Grand Dukes in the Dutch Republic. Within two decades, he became one of Amsterdam\u2019s wealthiest merchants.\nIn contrast to the first wave of immigrants, Feroni and his peers remained staunch Catholics. Thanks to his Roman contacts, he became an influential figure in the local Catholic minority community and he advocated its interests with the Protestant urban magistrate. Although it seems that Feroni never learnt Dutch, he thus was relatively well integrated.\nFrom the 1660s onward, a third wave of Italian migration followed suit. In response to the aggressive policies of King Louis XIV, Florentine bankers and merchants gradually withdrew from Paris and settled in Amsterdam. They stimulated a new increase both in the maritime and in the overland trade between the Dutch Republic and various Italian states. However, from the 1670s until the early 18th century, the Dutch economy entered a phase of stagnation and by then Amsterdam attracted less foreign merchants. In the 18th century, most Italian immigrants to the Dutch Republic would be artisans instead of merchants.\nFrancesco Feroni\u2019s extra-ordinary career testifies from the dynamic character of the Italian trade during an age in which the economy of the peninsula stagnated. His activities fit into a broader pattern and therefore it is worthwhile to analyze them.\n\u00a0\n", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_index": 365, "location": "Cherpack Seminar Room - 543 Williams Hall", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "title": "Hans Cools (Brueghel Visiting Professor at Penn) on Italians in Early Modern Amsterdam (Cherpack)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2019/10/hans-cools-brueghel-visiting-professor-penn-italians-early-modern-amsterdam-cherpack"},

We look forward to seeing many of you at this talk!\n\u00a0\n*****\nWhen Richard Wagner created a lowered orchestra pit at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in the 1870s he famously described the decision in terms of concealment; an attempt to hide the means of sound production. In view of the modifications made to numerous opera houses in the decades that followed to create similar orchestra pits, scholars have tended to assume that the Festspielhaus was both the stimulus and model for such spaces. If this tends to flatten out important variations in architectural design between theaters, it also narrates the introduction of orchestra pits from the perspective of audience members alone. While lowered orchestral platforms might have functioned as so-called \u201cmystical chasms\u201d from which sound floated upwards towards awed spectators, these also had a crucial role in the creation of enclosed, protected spaces for musicians.\nThe 1907 construction of the so-called \u201cgolfo mistico\u201d at the preeminent Teatro alla Scala in Milan, under the supervision of Arturo Toscanini, was to a considerable extent an experiment in the creation of a more professional atmosphere than performance at audience level allowed. However much the term golfo mistico betrays a Romantic conception of the space, it was not, I argue, coincidental that the pit was constructed in the same moment that trade unions for musicians were establishing themselves. Meanwhile, musicians were also becoming familiar with other sorts of enclosures calibrated to control acoustics and eliminate distractions, in the form of the earliest sound studios. Placing La Scala\u2019s golfo mistico in the context of these dual developments in the Italian music industry at the time, I reveal the extent of the orchestra pit\u2019s entanglements in a musical landscape which increasingly placed musicians at one remove from their audiences; in tandem, I offer a new framework in which to make sense of the new (and enduring) fashion for this architectural innovation.", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_index": 367, "location": "Music Building, Lerner Center 101", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "Prof. Laura Protano-Biggs", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "title": "Laura Protano-Biggs on the Teatro alla Scala in Milan (Music Building)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2019/11/laura-protano-biggs-teatro-alla-scala-milan-music-building"},

Law enforcement representatives instead push family members to settle problems on their own. Given such a context, this presentation explores how law and legal norms impact relationships between parents and children after divorce. All dynamics of post-divorce kinship begin from the legal fact that there is no joint custody in Japan. Throughout the postwar, rates of custody being granted to mothers have steadily increased, and currently stand at eighty percent. Moreover sole legal custody is coupled with a cultural belief that a \u201cclean break\u201d can benefit children because it is psychologically less damaging to have no contact with one parent than shuttle between two households. However there is a growing movement, organized mostly by non-custodial fathers, to \u201creform\u201d Japanese family law and popularize a joint custody option. This presentation focuses on both people who experienced a \u201cclean break\u201d divorce and those who are increasingly calling that disconnection into question. I argue that although there are no requirements for shared custody, a substantial minority of families sustain de facto joint custody. Demonstrating contested, shifting ideals of familial bonds, these attempts to share custody highlight desires to redress the disconnection divorce produces and to create connected families, even when they bring legal risks.\nAllison Alexy\u00a0is an assistant professor in the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures and Department of Women\u2019s Studies at the University of Michigan.

The first expansion of humans \u2013 Homo erectus- began 2.4 \u2013 1.8 million ago. The second expansion, this time of Homo sapiens sapiens, reached China between 85,000 and 80,000 BP. The expansion of speakers of Austronesian languages, returned to Africa, reaching Madagascar in the early centuries of the present era. The diffusion of domesticated plants, like bananas, from New Guinea to South Asia and Africa and dated to the mid-fourth millennium in Uganda and mid-first millennium BCE in southern Cameroon, provide additional evidence of interactions between Africa and Asia. Africa and Asia have long been in regular contact, through land and seas. \nHis paper will explore different facets of these Africa-Asia connections using glimpses gleaned from our ongoing archaeological research on the Island of Manda in Kenya, where we have unearthed excellent archaeological remains of the existence of trade between Africa and China. As to whether this interaction was direct, the jury is still out. Archaeologists presently accept the notion that the period between 700 and 1500 CE was the Era of Asian dominance.\u00a0 This was a time when the economic, social, and political order was vested in Buddhist and Islamist states, kingdoms, and empires. Interactions were dominated by regions that were connected by the Silk Road commercial complex.\nEastern and Southeastern Africa, which for millennia had pursued its own peculiar ways of making a living, was \u2018recruited\u2019 into this global network and became a regular partner. Its highly desirable resources included ambergris, aromatic products, iron bloom, gold, ivory, leopard skins, and rhinoceros\u2019 horns among others.\u00a0 Our paper address eastern Africa\u2019s participation in these transformational global networks using archaeological data. We specifically focus on two sets of data from the Manda site: Chinese porcelain and Identities of the participants in this trade, through a discussion on the human remains recovered at Manda.\n", "endtime": "05:30 PM", "event_index": 398, "location": "", "owner": "Center for East Asian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "4:30pm", "title": "CEAS Humanities Series \"Ancient trade networks between China and Africa\"", "url": "https://ceas.sas.upenn.edu/events/ceas-humanities-series-ancient-trade-networks-between-china-and-africa"},

Ch\u2019\u014fn drew on a wide network of relationships both inside and outside the court to help establish the first modern institution of Korean Buddhism, build the first modern temple in central Seoul, and open the first modern Buddhist clinic in Korea.

They grew especially alarmed at the growing power the government was giving to psychiatrists to oversee the psychological wellbeing of Americans. Using the state\u2019s police powers, they feared, liberals would soon declare anti-communists and other conservatives mentally ill and banish them to mental institutions. Two events in the 1950s brought these anxieties to a fever pitch: the involuntary confinement of Vermont anti-communist activist Lucille Miller to a federal psychiatric hospital and federal legislation to fund the construction of a mental hospital in the Alaska territory.\n  In their campaigns to free Miller and stop the construction of what they believed would be an Alaskan gulag, these activists turned to the law. They argued that the Constitution safeguarded a vision of liberty as the absence of unwanted government intrusions into an individual\u2019s life. While these ultraconservative activists were dismissed as crackpots, many of their critics also felt a sense of diminished autonomy in the postwar world. In subsequent decades, they too would grow wary of government paternalism and embrace, for various reasons, a more libertarian understanding of rights. This idea of rights would eclipse an alternative vision of them as a tool for pursuing collective, egalitarian ends. To our growing body of explanations about how communitarian possibilities for civil rights and civil liberties were \u201clost\u201d or \u201ctamed\u201d in the middle of the twentieth century, we might add anxieties about the fragility of the individual mind, which the cultural life of the Cold War drove to unprecedented levels.", "endtime": "1:20 PM", "event_index": 413, "location": "Faculty Lounge", "owner": "Law School", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "title": "Legal History Workshop: Daniel LaChance, Emory University", "url": "https://www.law.upenn.edu/newsevents/calendar.php#event_id/60767/view/event"},

Since the early nineteenth century, Americans opposed the immigration of poor foreign workers who would degrade the dignity of labor and lower American wage standards. The opposition to immigrant labor became especially strong in the case of contract workers. In 1885, American workers\u2019 antipathy to \u201calien contract labor\u201d resulted in the passage of the federal Foran Act to ban the landing of foreign contract workers and deport those already in the United States back to their countries of origin. This project examines how hostility toward contract labor migration influenced American immigration law and how the alien contract labor law in turn affected immigrant workers.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  The paper traces the intellectual and legal genealogy of alien contract labor law by surveying the antebellum roots of opposition to imported labor in the United States. While labor radicalism in the late nineteenth century played a crucial role in the introduction of the Foran Act, the federal law was built upon earlier discourses on servile labor and the economic impact on Americans of immigration of certain kinds. In particular, the paper identifies the following four issues in antebellum America as the ideological and legal origins of the alien contract labor law: 1) Free Soilism, 2) \u201cpauper labor\u201d discourse, 3) assisted emigration, and 4) coolieism. The analysis in this paper is not intended to provide new evidence or revise historiography on these topics. Instead, the paper aims to demonstrate how the antebellum debates over the four issues collectively, if not exclusively, laid the foundations for the federal alien contract labor law, placing it in the broader framework of immigration politics beyond the labor conflict in the late nineteenth century.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Hidetaka Hirota is a non-tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Institute for Advanced Study at Waseda University in Japan.

Forster to Zora Neale Hurston.\u00a0 Received to widespread acclaim, Zadie Smith's first novel, White Teeth (2000), is a vibrant portrait of contemporary multicultural London, told through the story of three ethnically diverse families. The book won a number of awards and prizes, including the Guardian First Book Award, Whitbread First Novel Award, Commonwealth Writers Prize (Overall Winner, Best First Book), and two BT Ethnic and Multicultural Media Awards (Best Book/Novel and Best Female Media Newcomer). It was also shortlisted for the Mail on Sunday/John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, the Orange Prize for Fiction, and the Author\u2019s Club First Novel Award. White Teeth has been translated into over twenty languages and was adapted for Channel 4 television for broadcast in autumn 2002. Her tenure as Writer in Residence at the Institute of Contemporary Arts resulted in the publication of an anthology of erotic stories entitled Piece of Flesh (2001). More recently, she has written the introduction for The Burned Children of America (2003), a collection of eighteen short stories by a new generation of young American writers.Zadie Smith\u2019s second novel, The Autograph Man (2002), is a story of loss, obsession and the nature of celebrity. It won the 2003 Jewish Quarterly Literary Prize for Fiction. In 2003 and 2013 Granta magazine named her as one of 20 Best of Young British Novelists. Her third novel, On Beauty (2005), won the 2006 Orange Prize for Fiction. She has also written a nonfiction book about writing entitled Fail Better (2006).

Archaeologist Bernard Frischer, an international authority on virtual heritage, describes his remarkable project to scan, model, and digitally restore to their full color and shape representative statues and other sculptures from this World Heritage Site.\nBernard Frischer is a leading digital humanist widely published on virtual heritage, Classics, and the survival of the Classical world.He received his B.A. in Classics from Wesleyan University and his Ph.D. in Classics from the University of Heidelberg. He taught Classics at UCLA from 1976 to 2004, following which he was Professor of Art History and Classics at the University of Virginia until joining Indiana University in 2013.Frischer has been a guest professor at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Bologna, and Beijing Normal University and held the post of Professor-in-Charge of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome. He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa, a Fellow of the Michigan Society of Fellows, a Fellow and trustee of the American Academy in Rome. He has also won research fellowships from the American Council of Learned Societies and the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts. From 1996 to 2003 he directed the excavations of Horace's Villa sponsored by the American Academy in Rome, and from 1996 to 2004 he was founding director of the UCLA Cultural Virtual Reality Laboratory. The lab was one of the first in the world to use 3D computer modeling to reconstruct cultural heritage sites. Frischer has overseen many significant modeling projects, including \"Rome Reborn,\" the virtual recreation of the entire city of ancient Rome within the Aurelian Walls.

The vast journey of blue moves from Hebrew ritual uses of snail pigments to the chemistry and economics of blue jean dyes.\nAmerican chemist Roald Hoffmann is widely known for using quantum mechanics to help reveal the mechanisms of chemical reactions. He was born Roald Safran in 1937 in a small Polish town that is now part of the Ukraine. Hoffmann's father was a civil engineer familiar with the local infrastructure, which made him of value to the Nazis. For a while the family was allowed to remain in its own home, but was later relocated to a labor camp, where many of the Nazi guards could be bribed. After being paid off, the guards allowed 5-year-old Roald, his mother, two aunts, and an uncle to escape in early 1943. A Ukrainian couple hid them in the attic and storeroom of a nearby schoolhouse where the husband taught. Hoffmann's father remained behind in the camp, where he was tortured and killed by the Nazis in June 1943 for his involvement in a plot to arm camp prisoners.After the war ended, Hoffmann and his mother relocated to New York, where he later won a Westinghouse science scholarship to Columbia University, earning his BA there. He took his doctorate in chemistry from Harvard and in 1965 began teaching chemistry at Cornell, where he is now Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters Emeritus. Since 2002, Hoffmann has hosted a monthly cabaret called \"Entertaining Science\" at Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9 in Greenwich Village.In 1963 Hoffmann introduced the extended H\u00fcckel method, a molecular orbital theory that allows calculation of the electronic structure of molecules. In 1965, in collaboration with Nobel laureate Robert Burns Woodward, he introduced the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a method for exploring the electronic structure of transition states and intermediates in organic reactions. Hoffmann and Japanese chemist Kenichi Fukui shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1981 for their theories, developed independently, concerning the course of chemical reactions (Woodward had died two years earlier and thus was ineligible).Hoffmann is also a published poet, playwright, and essayist. His poems appear in several collections: The Metamict State (1987), Gaps and Verges (1990), Memory Effects (1999), and Soliton (2002). In addition, he is a philosopher of science who has made significant contributions to our conceptual, historical, and normative understanding of chemistry. Many of his philosophical essays have been collected in Roald Hoffman on the Philosophy, Art, and Science of Chemistry by Jeffrey Kovac and Michael Weisberg, eds. (2012).", "endtime": "6:30pm", "event_index": 467, "location": "Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:00pm", "title": "The Allure of Indigo", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/allure-indigo"},

Through film, photography and performance, the artists in this exhibition explore the contours of belonging across different contexts - from the invention of nationalist social rituals to the homecoming of veterans, from the trope of the \"haunted\" house to that of the family portrait. By bringing together the work of an international group of artists approaching home as a volatile concept, this exhibition examines how fantasies of belonging involve complex psychic and affective responses to specific material and historical conditions informed by race, gender, sexuality and class.\"Itinerant Belongings\" grounds this inquiry by revisiting critical debates that bridged activism and art in the 1980s and 1990s. Responding to the presence of the homeless, the displaced, and the disenfranchised in American cities, two of the artists in the exhibition, William Pope.L and Krzysztof Wodiczko, produced projects in this critical moment that questioned the very notion of what it meant for a space to be \"public.\" This exhibition aims to reanimate this dialogue and extend it to a contemporary global landscape marked by mass displacement, armed conflict, and debates around borders and immigration.Work by Yael Bartana, Jamie Diamond, Andrew Moore, William Pope.L, Paul Salveson, Jessica Vaughn, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, and Krzysztof Wodiczko will be on display at Slought and the Addams Gallery at PennDesign, and viewers are encouraged to take an itinerant path from one exhibition site to another.\nMore information", "endtime": "", "event_index": 468, "location": "Slought, 4017 Walnut Street, PhiladelphiaAddams Fine Arts Hall, 200 S. 36th Street, Philadelphia", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "", "title": "Itinerant Belongings", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/itinerant-belongings"},

How do their patterns provide protective camouflage in tropical rain forests? How is nanotechnology using the waterproofing properties of butterfly colors to fabricate energy-efficient materials for buildings? In this panel discussion, Penn researchers discuss how their scientific and technological work imitates nature.\nUsing holographic lithography, Shu Yang and her Penn research team recently developed a material that mimics the iridescent and water-resistant qualities of butterfly wings. Applying this innovation, they developed a superhydrophobic coating that can be sprayed onto any surface. The solution contains nanoscopic particles that add a nearly invisible layer of roughness to a surface. Among other things, this highly water resistant coating is now being used on solar panels to keep them drier, cleaner and more efficient.\nIn 2004, Shu Yang was named one of the World's Top 100 Innovators Under 35 by MIT Technology Review. In 2006, she received the prestigious Faculty Early Career Development Award from the National Science Foundation. And in 2011, she was selected by the National Academy of Engineering to present at the Japan-America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium. In addition to being widely published, Dr. Yang holds over 20 patents, issued or pending.\nDaniel Janzen is an evolutionary ecologist, biologist, and conservationist renowned for his pioneering work in tropical ecology and the conservation of endangered tropical ecosystems throughout the world. A former director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, he divides his time between Penn, where he teaches biology, and his research and field work in Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, he serves as technical advisor to Area de Conservacion Guanacaste (ACG), a 165,000 hectare government/private hybrid conservation area. He is also president of the Guanacaste Dry Forest Conservation Fund (GDFCF), the US-based NGO for ACG.\nHe and his wife, Winnie Hallwachs, are currently working to further the CBOL (Consortium for the Barcode of Life) and iBOL (International Barcode of Life) efforts to DNA barcode all species of the world for their identification and species discovery by anyone anywhere at any time.

Value with respect to color can mean the relative lightness or darkness of a hue, but can also mean aesthetic merit, political importance, moral acceptability, or material worth. The question of color's values is also fundamentally a question of sensory perception, constructed at the level of the individual synapse as well as the cultural collective. We want to consider the descriptive language of color\u2014how we evoke color with and/or through value-laden words or actions, how we assign qualities or quantities to different colors, how color is experienced through taste or touch as well as sight.Four distinguished scholars - Richard Doyle, Torkwase Dyson, Nicole Fleetwood, and Mohan Matthen - will explore the values of color from a variety of perspectives. How and why do we classify and assign values (moral, economic, social, epistemic) to particular colors, even 'people of color,' or material gradations, from light to dark? How does color function in a modern economy? What is its role in making subjectivity legible through its performance? How does color function as nonverbal communication that is affectively felt?

He directs the Laboratory for Perception and Action at the Baylor College of Medicine, whose goal is to understand how the brain constructs perception, how different brains do so differently, and how this matters for society. He also founded and directs Baylor's Initiative on Neuroscience and Law, which studies how new discoveries in neuroscience should navigate the way we make laws, punish criminals, and develop rehabilitation. And, he founded and is chief scientific officer for BrainCheck, a company that uses interactive testing on portable tablets to measure brain function, which schools are using to rapidly measure concussions at the sidelines.\nIn 2011, Eagleman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and that same year won the Eric Hoffer Book Award Montaigne Medal for his book Wednesday is Indigo Blue: Discovering the Brain of Synesthesia, coauthored with Richard Cytowic. In 2012 he was named Science Educator of the Year by the Society for Neuroscience, and was featured as one of the year's Brightest Idea Guys by Italy's Style Magazine. In 2014, he received the John J. McGovern Award for Excellence in Biomedical Education from the American Medical Writers' Association.\nOne of his latest books, Livewired: How the Brain Rewrites its Own Circuitry, is due in spring 2015 (Doubleday Canada). Also in Fall 2015, Eagleman will host the new PBS science series, \"The Brain with Dr. David Eagleman.\"\nFrom the Eagleman Laboratory website, in his own words:\"Public understanding of science is a passion of mine, and to that end I have written for the New York Times, Discover Magazine, Atlantic, The Week, Slate, Wired, New Scientist, and others. I speak often on National Public Radio and BBC to discuss what's new and important in science. I have founded a prize in mathematics and physics.\"I am fortunate to be a Guggenheim Fellow. Within the scientific community, I serve as an editor for Journal of Vision, PLoS One, and Seminars in Brain and Consciousness. I also serve on the board of directors for several organizations, including The Long Now Foundation.\"My book of fiction, Sum, was lucky enough to become an international bestseller. It has been translated into 27 languages and was named a Best Book of the Year by Barnes and Noble, New Scientist, and the Chicago Tribune. British musician Brian Eno and I performed a musical reading of Sum at the Sydney Opera House, and German composer Max Richter translated Sum into a full opera at the Royal Opera House in London.\"My neuroscience book Incognito became a New York Times bestseller, and was named a Book of the Year by Amazon, Goodreads, Houston Chronicle, and Boston Globe. No one is writing an opera for that one yet, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.\"", "endtime": "6:30pm", "event_index": 481, "location": "Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:00pm", "title": "The Kaledioscopic Brain of Synesthesia", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/kaledioscopic-brain-synesthesia"},

A finalist for the 2016 Pulitzer Prize in Music, Fure also won a Lincoln Center Emerging Artists Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Rome Prize in Music Composition, a DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Prize, a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grant for Artists, a Fulbright Fellowship to France, and a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship from Columbia University. Her work has been commissioned by major ensembles throughout Europe and the United States including The New York Philharmonic, The Los Angeles Philharmonic, Klangforum Wien, Ensemble Modern, Diotima Quartet, and the International Contemporary Ensemble.

We look forward to seeing many of you at this talk!\n\nWhen Richard Wagner created a lowered orchestra pit at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in the 1870s he famously described the decision in terms of concealment; an attempt to hide the means of sound production. In view of the modifications made to numerous opera houses in the decades that followed to create similar orchestra pits, scholars have tended to assume that the Festspielhaus was both the stimulus and model for such spaces. If this tends to flatten out important variations in architectural design between theaters, it also narrates the introduction of orchestra pits from the perspective of audience members alone. While lowered orchestral platforms might have functioned as so-called \u201cmystical chasms\u201d from which sound floated upwards towards awed spectators, these also had a crucial role in the creation of enclosed, protected spaces for musicians.\n\nThe 1907 construction of the so-called \u201cgolfo mistico\u201d at the preeminent Teatro alla Scala in Milan, under the supervision of Arturo Toscanini, was to a considerable extent an experiment in the creation of a more professional atmosphere than performance at audience level allowed. However much the term golfo mistico betrays a Romantic conception of the space, it was not, I argue, coincidental that the pit was constructed in the same moment that trade unions for musicians were establishing themselves. Meanwhile, musicians were also becoming familiar with other sorts of enclosures calibrated to control acoustics and eliminate distractions, in the form of the earliest sound studios. Placing La Scala\u2019s golfo mistico in the context of these dual developments in the Italian music industry at the time, I reveal the extent of the orchestra pit\u2019s entanglements in a musical landscape which increasingly placed musicians at one remove from their audiences; in tandem, I offer a new framework in which to make sense of the new (and enduring) fashion for this architectural innovation.", "endtime": "06:15 PM", "event_index": 495, "location": "", "owner": "Department of Music", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:15pm", "title": "Laura Protano-Biggs on the Teatro alla Scala in Milan", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/music/events/laura-protano-biggs-teatro-alla-scala-milan"},

The dominant narrative in the media and among academics is that we believe misinformation because we want to \u2014 that is, we engage in motivated reasoning, using our cognitive capacities to convince ourselves of the truth of statements that align with our political ideology rather than to undercover the truth. In a series of survey experiments using American participants, David Rand and colleagues challenged this account. They consistently found that subjects who perform better on the Cognitive Reflection Test (a measure of the tendency to engage in analytic thinking) are better able to identify false or biased headlines \u2014 even for headlines that align with individuals\u2019 political ideology (for details, see here and here). They also found that when examining actual Twitter behavior, more reflective individuals share information from higher quality news sources. These findings suggest that susceptibility to misinformation is driven more by mental laziness and lack of reasoning than it is by partisan bias hijacking the reasoning process. They then build on this observation to examine interventions to fight the spread of misinformation. In one, they show that laypeople are much less biased in their evaluation of the trustworthiness of news outlets than one might imagine, and give fake news and hyperpartisan outlets low trust ratings regardless of their political slant. Thus, using crowdsourced ratings of outlet quality to inform social media ranking algorithms is a promising approach (for details, see here). Second, the researchers demonstrate the power of making the concept of accuracy top-of-mind, thereby increasing the likelihood that people think about the accuracy of headlines before they decide whether to share them. Rand's results suggest that reasoning is not held hostage by partisan bias, but that instead participants do have the ability to tell fake or inaccurate from real \u2014 if they bother to pay attention. The findings also suggest simple, cost-effective behavioral interventions to fight the spread of misinformation.\nAbout the Speaker\nDavid G. Rand is the Erwin H. Schell Professor and an Associate Professor of Management Science and Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT Sloan, and the Director of the Human Cooperation Laboratory and the Applied Cooperation Team.\nBridging the fields of behavioral economics and psychology, Rand\u2019s research combines mathematical/computational models with human behavioral experiments and online/field studies to understand human behavior.

If infrastructure conditions how information, people, and things circulate, then what might the practices of concealment tell us about the political stakes of circulation, and about the nature of our infrastructural surround? What kinds of visual forms emerge in global media events in which concealment is crucial part, sometimes even the condition of possibility for targetable people and equipment to stay on air. This colloquium examines these contradictions in the context of Lebanon, where infrastructural disrepair and breakdown parallel political impasses and fragmentation. It takes the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year as its case study. Based on fieldwork and visual analysis, El-Hibri examines how concealment structures phenomena ranging from live satellite news broadcasts, drone-cam footage, signal jamming and hacking, and online guerilla video from the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year. He shows how televisual liveness in this event \u2014 that new-again promise to see things faraway as they happen \u2014 demonstrates how the geopolitics of simultaneity has transformed in the contemporary moment.\nAbout the Speaker\nHatim El-Hibri is a\u00a0Faculty Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication and an\u00a0Assistant Professor of Film and Media at George Mason University.

In his book,\u00a0The Palestinian Idea, Greg Burris argues that it is precisely through film and media that hope can occasionally emerge amidst hopelessness, emancipation amidst oppression, freedom amidst apartheid. The author employs the work of Edward W. Said, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, and Cedric J. Robinson in order to locate Palestinian utopia in the heart of the Zionist present. He analyzes the films of prominent directors Annemarie Jacir (Salt of This Sea,\u00a0When I Saw You) and Hany Abu-Assad (Paradise Now) to investigate the emergence and formation of Palestinian identity. Looking at Mais Darwazah\u2019s documentary\u00a0My Love Awaits Me by the Sea, Burris considers the counterhistories that make up the Palestinian experience\u2014stories and memories that have otherwise been obscured or denied. He also examines Palestinian (in)visibility in the global media landscape, and how issues of Black-Palestinian transnational solidarity are illustrated through social media, staged news spectacles, and hip hop music.\u00a0\n\"A deeply felt, brilliantly conceived, meticulously crafted book,\u00a0The Palestinian Idea\u00a0breaks new ground in how we understand vision, space, and identity.

How is certain novel information about the world nevertheless made meaningful in their everyday lives? While a growing number of studies have focused on the role of multi-platform mobile technology in young people\u2019s daily experiences, few studies have aimed to reconceptualize news from this perspective, paying particular attention to the phenomenology of news perception in the digital age. Such a reconceptualization is all the more important since the basic dimensions of phenomenology \u2013 namely, time, space and cultural relevance \u2013 coincide with the basic dimensions of news as a cultural form. This talk will draw from ongoing fieldwork with college students in Kazan, Russia, focusing particularly on the challenges of conducting a \u201cnews reception\u201d study when what counts as \u201cnews\u201d is not separable from the rest of their coming-of-age experiences on and offline.\nNatalia Roudakova is a cultural anthropologist (Ph.D., Stanford University, 2007) working in the fields of political communication, journalism, and media studies, with an interest in moral philosophy and political and cultural theory.

Through a consideration of the television set\u2019s intertwining with devices ranging from VCRs to set-top boxes and optical-fiber cables, Chirumamilla exposes new veins of analysis through which we might understand both the inter-media history within which television in South India is embedded and the kinds of mediated futures that television\u2019s material transformations portend.\n\u00a0\nFollowing an overview of her larger project, which utilizes both ethnographic research and close textual analysis of newspapers, enthusiast magazines, and policy documents, Chirumamilla will turn her focus to the objects of the television set, the videotape, and the VCR. How does looking at these objects in concert with each other change our imagining of the historical trajectory of television in South India? She will argue that the television set\u2019s entanglement with videotapes and the VCR is illustrative of the contentious, close relationship between the commercial cinema industry and television\u2019s growing presence within the lives of Indian media consumers; an entanglement that has so far gone understudied and might offer us new ways to think about how we theorize the pasts and futures of media technologies.\n\u00a0\n\nAbout the Speaker\nPadma Chirumamilla\u00a0is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication. Her work examines how media infrastructures shape and are shaped by everyday cultural life and labor in postcolonial South India and the broader Global South. Her dissertation investigates how the television \u2014 both the physical object and the broader media entity \u2014 were integrated into the daily rhythms of viewers and media workers in small-town and rural regions in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, through venues like the repair shop and technologies likes the videotape and VCR. Through a combination of ethnographic and textually-based methods, Chirumamilla\u2019s research considers how the materiality of media shapes its absorption into the routines and rhythms of everyday life in the Global South. She is also interested in notions of technological futurity, and how the futuristic allure of digital technologies configures everyday encounters with media infrastructures in the Global South.

While conventional wisdom often takes a dim view of nonconvex optimization algorithms due to their susceptibility to spurious local minima, simple iterative methods such as gradient descent have been remarkably successful in practice. The theoretical footings, however, had been largely lacking until recently. This talk presents two recent stories about nonconvex statistical estimation, which highlight the important role of statistical models in enabling efficient nonconvex optimization. The first story is about randomly initialized nonconvex methods for a phase retrieval problem: even without careful initialization, simple algorithms like gradient descent provably find the global solution within a logarithmic number of iterations. The second story is concerned with uncertainty quantification for nonconvex low-rank matrix completion. We develop a de-biased estimator \u2014 on the basis of a nonconvex estimate \u2014 that enables optimal construction of confidence intervals for the missing entries of the unknown matrix. All of this is achieved via a leave-one-out statistical analysis framework, which is very powerful in handling and decoupling complicated statistical dependency.\nThis is joint work with Cong Ma, Yuling Yan, Yuejie Chi, and Jianqing Fan.", "endtime": "4:00 PM", "event_index": 666, "location": "Room 401B, 3401 Walnut,  3401 Walnut Street", "owner": "School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS)", "speaker": "Yuxin Chen\nAssistant Professor in Electrical Engineering at Princeton University\nYuxin Chen is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University.

For these applications, visual-inertial odometry is a common way to localize the vehicles and observe the environment. However, unlike with wheeled mobile robots, quadrotor localization algorithms often do not use knowledge of the control inputs and the full vehicle dynamics as a process model for localization. Rather, they use kinematic models, with the IMU providing acceleration and angular velocity. One of the reasons for avoiding the use of dynamics is that, until recently quadrotor aerodynamic effects have not been considered in the literature and hence the dynamic models for quadrotors have been less accurate than those for wheeled mobile robots. The main aerodynamic terms that are significant are first-order effects that are linear in velocity and angular velocity. They are predominantly caused by aerodynamic interaction with the spinning propellers. This work investigates the models for such effects, as well as what can be gained if such aerodynamic effects are incorporated into the dynamic model and the full dynamics are used for state estimation. We develop novel IMU-based filters, the end results of which are used to estimate the wind velocity of the quadrotor or, indoors, when the ambient wind is zero, the velocity of the quadrotor. In addition, these filters estimate the many aerodynamic parameters in the model online. They may also be used to estimate sensor biases and inertial parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these filters through experiments. We also present nonlinear observability analyses that theoretically determine the observability properties of the systems.\nCommittee Members:\nVijay Kumar, Nemirovsky Family Dean of Engineering\nAni Hsieh, Research Associate Professor, MEAM\nKostas Daniliidis,\u00a0Ruth Yalom Stone Professor, CIS\nCamillo J.

The inherently mesoscopic nature of solid-state platforms leads to a multitude of dynamics between spins, charges, vibrations and light. Implementing a high level of control on these constituents and their interactions with each other creates exciting opportunities for realizing stationary and flying qubits within the context of spin-based quantum information science, as well as investigating mesoscopic quantum systems. Quantum optics, developed originally for atomic systems, provides a very valuable toolbox for this endeavour.

While these systems provide high-quality images, the improved functionality comes at the cost of increased size and weight. One route to reduce a system\u2019s complexity is via computational imaging, in which much of the aberration correction and functionality of the optical hardware is shifted to post-processing in the software realm. Alternatively, a designer could miniaturize the optics by replacing them with diffractive optical elements, which mimic the functionality of refractive systems in a more compact form factor. Metasurfaces are an extreme example of such diffractive elements, in which quasiperiodic arrays of resonant subwavelength optical antennas impart spatially-varying changes on a wavefront.

This \u201cbiomimetic\u201d approach results in an increasingly successful representation of the environmental milieu of tissue development, regeneration and disease.

Platelet aggregation is largely a physical process while coagulation is biochemical, consisting of a large network of reactions that culminate in the generation of the enzyme thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin, which polymerizes into fibers to form a stabilizing gel matrix in and around growing platelet aggregates. Thrombin also (re)binds directly to fibrin but this interaction, and its purpose, is not fully understood. Thrombin-fibrin binding is often described as two independent, single-step binding events, one high-affinity and one low-affinity, each through a different exosite on thrombin. However, kinetic schemes describing these single-step binding events with reported kinetic rate constants cannot explain experimentally-observed residency times of fibrin-bound thrombin. In this work, we study a bivalent, sequential-step binding scheme as an alternative to the high-affinity event, and in addition to the low-affinity one. We developed mathematical models for the single- and sequential-step schemes consisting of reaction-diffusion equations to compare to each other and to previously published experimental data. We then used Bayesian inference, in the form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo, to learn model parameter distributions from the experimental data. For the model to best fit the data, we needed an additional assumption that thrombin was irreversibly sequestered; we hypothesized that this could be due to thrombin becoming physically trapped within fibrin fibers as they formed. We also discuss how our model can be used to further probe scenarios dealing with thrombin allostery.", "endtime": "3:00 PM", "event_index": 680, "location": "Towne 337", "owner": "Penn Institute for Computational Science (PICS)", "speaker": "Karin Leiderman\nAssociate Professor, Director of Graduate Studies, Department of Applied Math & Statistics, Colorado School of Mines\nKarin Leiderman is an Associate Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Colorado School of Mines.

To bring these properties from the lab to the commercial space will require innovative nanomanufacturing strategies focused on scalable and cost-effective techniques. My lab, the Hybrid Micro/Nanomanufacturing Laboratory, applies the manipulation of fundamental driving forces to this challenge through combinations of top-down and bottom-up techniques for new hybrid lithographic strategies. In this seminar, I will highlight one such strategy: self-limiting electrospray deposition (SLED) of thin film microcoatings. Electrospray deposition is a well-established technique for the creation of thin films from the spray of highly charged droplets loaded with the materials to be deposited. In SLED, specific manipulation of the electrostatic repulsion, hydrodynamic forces, and evaporation kinetics can be employed to conformally cover 3D architectures with microcoatings. The generated coatings are hierarchical, possessing either nanoshell or nanowire microstructure. Having demonstrated the mechanism of the self-limiting effect, we have developed the ability to employ materials that would be otherwise incompatible with self-limiting. In this way we have incorporated a wide variety of functional systems, including: (1) biocompatible, (2) plasmonic, (3) elastomerically-toughened composite, (4) anti-corrosive epoxy or sol gel, and (5) electrically conductive coatings. We have also characterized the geometric limits of features that can be coated through this approach, showing that the 3D capabilities increase with decreasing feature size to the micron-scale. This property, combined with the hierarchical structure of the coatings, shifts the burden of micro/nanoscale resolution from a costly or slow technique to a more scalable method, thereby removing barriers for integration into advanced manufacturing techniques such as roll-to-roll or additive manufacturing.", "endtime": "12:00 PM", "event_index": 689, "location": "Wu and Chen Auditorium (Room 101), Levine Hall,  3330 Walnut Street", "owner": "Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM)", "speaker": "Jonathan Singer\nAssistant Professor, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Rutgers University\nJonathan Singer obtained his PhD (2013) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and MSc and BS (2008) from the University of Pennsylvania, all in Materials Science and Engineering.

Dr. Christopher Ashford, Executive Director of Penn Futures, will facilitate a discussion on James Baldwin's essay, \"A Report From Occupied Territory.\" Refreshments will be served! Baldwin, an American novelist, playwright, and activist, explored intricacies of racial, sexual, and class distinctions in Western societies. His essay,\u00a0A Report from Occupied Territory, focuses on the impact of segregated education, joblessness and police brutality in marginalized communities. Although written several decades ago, Baldwin\u2019s observations are still relevant and continue to resonate. This initiative represents one of several activities that have been established as part of HEARD (Hub for Equity, Anti-Oppression, Research, and Development). A goal of this reading group is to discuss various readings on topics that interrogate structures of power and the re/production of forms of oppression related to race, religion, gender, class, legal status, citizenship, etc., and to consider how these issues impact our work here at GSE. It is our hope that this reading group will provide opportunities for us to learn from each other as we engage in rich conversations on these topics. This year, we will be featuring essays, articles, brief videos, and short stories written by authors who have focused on various types of oppression.

To address this problem, we propose a paradigm shift. The current paradigm centers on generating one estimate at a time using a unique study design with unknown reliability and publishing (or not) one estimate at a time. The new paradigm advocates for high-throughput observational studies using consistent and standardized methods, allowing evaluation, calibration, and unbiased dissemination to generate a more reliable and complete evidence base. We demonstrate this new paradigm by comparing all hypertension treatments for a set of effectiveness and safety outcomes, producing 587,020 hazard ratios, each using methodology on par with state-of-the-art studies. We furthermore include control hypotheses to evaluate and calibrate our evidence generation process. Results agree with the limited number of randomized trials. The distribution of effect size estimates reported in literature reveals an absence of small or null effects, with a sharp cutoff at p = 0.05.

In simple models, causal parameters of interest are identified by variations of the functional known as the g-formula, and estimated using parametric and semi-parametric frameworks for statistical inference. Identification by the g-formula, and subsequent estimation methods in fully observed models have a clean interpretation in terms of the Markov factorization with respect to a directed acyclic graph (DAG). I show that this interpretation may be extended to arbitrary hidden variable causal models using a more involved nested Markov factorization with respect to a directed mixed graph. This view leads to a simple characterization of non-parametric identification for many parameters in causal inference, including causal effects, direct, indirect, and path-specific effects, responses to counterfactual policies, and many others. In addition, the nested Markov factorization avoids certain paradoxes associated with causal nulls, and leads to well-behaved model likelihoods that avoid making assumptions on unobserved variables, while capturing the structure these variables induce on the observed marginal distribution. This structure takes the form of all equality constraints induced by the hidden variable model, including conditional independences and \u201cVerma constraints.\u201d These restrictions may be used to make statistical inference more computationally tractable via probabilistic calculation procedures that generalize variable elimination algorithms in machine learning.", "endtime": "5:30 pm", "event_index": 799, "location": "F45 Huntsman Hall", "owner": "Wharton Statistics Seminars", "speaker": "Ilya Shpitser \u2013 Johns Hopkins University", "starttime": "4:30pm", "title": "Identification and Estimation of Causal Parameters via a Modified Factorization of a Graphical Model", "url": "https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/identification-and-estimation-of-causal-parameters-via-a-modified-factorization-of-a-graphical-model"},

In recent years graphical rules have been derived for determining, from a causal diagram, all covariate adjustment sets. Restricting attention to causal linear models, a very recent article introduced two graphical criterions: one to compare the asymptotic variance of linear regression estimators that control for certain distinct adjustment sets and a second to identify the optimal adjustment set that provides the smallest asymptotic variance. In this talk, I will show that the same graphical criterions can be used in arbitrary causal diagrams when the goal is to minimize the asymptotic variance of non-parametric estimators of ATE that ignore the causal diagram assumptions. Furthermore, I will provide a graphical criterion to determine the optimal adjustment set among the minimal adjustment sets. In addition, I will provide another graphical criterion for determining when a non-parametric estimator of ATE is as efficient as an efficient estimator that exploits the causal diagram assumptions. Finally, I will show that for estimating the effect of time dependent treatments in the presence of time dependent confounders, there exist diagrams with no optimal adjustment sets.", "endtime": "5:30 pm", "event_index": 800, "location": "F45 Huntsman Hall", "owner": "Wharton Statistics Seminars", "speaker": "Andrea Rotnitzky \u2013 Universidad Torcuato Di Tella", "starttime": "4:30pm", "title": "Efficient Adjustment Sets for Non-parametric Population Average Causal Effect Estimation in Graphical Models", "url": "https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/efficient-adjustment-sets-for-non-parametric-population-average-causal-effect-estimation-in-graphical-models/"},

Methods for assessing the\u00a0sensitivity\u00a0of a study\u2019s conclusions to unmeasured confounding have been devised for testing sharp null hypotheses, most commonly that the treatment effect is constant across all individuals. It has been argued that certain patterns of hidden bias may be directly attributable to the existence of heterogeneous treatment effects, stoking fear that sensitivity analyses assuming constant effects may be inadequate. We present a new method for\u00a0sensitivity\u00a0analysis\u00a0for the sample average treatment effect in paired observational studies while leaving the individual-level treatment effects unspecified. Our recommended procedure relates recent work on\u00a0robust\u00a0permutation tests to observational studies, where randomizations are no longer drawn uniformly. The method naturally extends conventional modes of inference for the sample average treatment effect in paired experiments to the case of unknown, but bounded, probabilities of assignment to treatment. We further assess the performance of existing methods for sensitivity analysis when the assumption of effect homogeneity is violated.

Its causal identification relies on the assumption of parallel trends, which is scale dependent and may be questionable in some applications. A common alternative is a regression model that adjusts for the lagged dependent variable, which rests on the assumption of ignorability conditional on past outcomes. In this paper, we show a general nonparametric bracketing relationship between the difference-in-differences and lagged-dependent-variable regression estimates, under testable assumptions. Namely, for a true positive effect, if ignorability is correct, then mistakenly assuming parallel trends will overestimate the effect; in contrast, if the parallel trends assumption is correct, then mistakenly assuming ignorability will underestimate the effect. This provides a general strategy to construct bounds for the treatment effects. We provide three examples to illustrate the theoretical results.

A key theoretical and practical assumption of most methods, however, is that they have access to independent samples from the entire distribution of relevant data. As such, these methods often fail catastrophically in the face of biased data which breaks this assumption. In this talk, we focus on bias due to censoring or truncation, where samples falling outside of an \u201cobservation window\u201d are unreliable or cannot be observed due e.g. to measurement errors, legal or privacy constraints, or biased data collection. We present a general framework based on stochastic gradient descent for regression and classification from truncated samples. While the framework is broadly applicable, we also instantiate it to obtain computationally and statistically efficient methods for truncated density estimation and truncated linear, logistic and probit regression in high dimensions. We also provide experiments to illustrate the practicality of our framework on synthetic and real data.

This practice, termed post-selection inference in the statistical literature, may negatively affect both point estimation and uncertainty quantification in A/B testing, and therefore hinder trustworthy decision making. To address this issue, we explore two seemingly unrelated paths, one based on supervised machine learning and the other on empirical Bayes, and propose post-selection inferential approaches that combine the strengths of both. Via large-scale simulated and empirical examples, we demonstrate that our proposed methodologies stand out among other existing methods in both reducing post-selection biases and improving confidence interval coverage rates, and discuss how they can be conveniently adjusted to real-life scenarios.", "endtime": "5:30 pm", "event_index": 805, "location": "F45 Huntsman Hall", "owner": "Wharton Statistics Seminars", "speaker": "Alex (Shaojie) Deng \u2013 Microsoft Analysis and Experimentation Team", "starttime": "4:30pm", "title": "Trustworthy Post-selection Inference in A/B Testing", "url": "https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/trustworthy-post-selection-inference-in-a-b-testing"},

This privacy definition, however, has some well-known weaknesses: notably, it does not tightly handle composition. This weakness has inspired several recent relaxations of differential privacy based on Renyi divergences. We propose an alternative relaxation of differential privacy, which we term \u201cf-DP\u201d, which has a number of nice properties and avoids some of the difficulties associated with divergence based relaxations. First, it preserves the hypothesis testing interpretation of differential privacy, which makes its guarantees easily interpretable. It allows for lossless reasoning about composition and post-processing, and notably, a direct way to analyze privacy amplification by subsampling. We define a canonical single-parameter family of definitions within our class that is termed \u201cGaussian Differential Privacy\u201d, based on hypothesis testing of two shifted normal distributions. We prove that this family is focal to f-DP by introducing a central limit theorem, which shows that the privacy guarantees of any hypothesis-testing based definition of privacy (including differential privacy) converge to Gaussian differential privacy in the limit under composition. This central limit theorem also gives a tractable analysis tool. We demonstrate the use of the tools we develop by giving an improved analysis of the privacy guarantees of noisy stochastic gradient descent.

However, it remains poorly understood under what conditions groups outperform comparable individuals, which individual attributes best predict collective performance, or how task complexity mediates these relationships. Here we describe a novel two-phase experiment in which individuals were evaluated on a series of tasks of varying complexity; then randomly assigned to solve similar tasks either in groups of different compositions or as individuals. We describe two main sets of findings. First, while groups score higher than individuals across all complexity levels, they underperform a comparably sized \"nominal group\" of independent workers. Moreover, whereas both individuals and nominal groups are more efficient than groups when the task is simple, groups are more efficient for complex tasks. Second, we find that average skill level easily dominates all other factors combined, including social perceptiveness, skill diversity, and diversity of cognitive style, independent of task complexity. Our findings help to clarify inconsistencies in the existing literature and illustrate the utility of a \"solution-oriented\" approach to identifying principles of collective performance.", "endtime": "1:20 pm", "event_index": 853, "location": "JMHH 370", "owner": "Decision Processes Colloquia (Wharton)", "speaker": "Duncan Watts\nProfessor, Operations, Information and Decisions\u00a0\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, The Wharton School", "starttime": " 12:00 ", "title": "Collective Problem-Solving of Groups Across Tasks of Varying Complexity", "url": "https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/events/dpcolloquia/"},

Beyond economic issues of when to optimally claim, individual differences in psychological preferences can also affect the claiming decision. While different strands of research have investigated the impact of heterogeneity on the claiming decision, as well as the impact of information displays and interventions on claiming intentions, there has been little work pulling together both measurement of individual differences and impacts of interventions in the same experiment. In this research, we test 1) the effectiveness of 13 different interventions meant to help consumers better reason about claiming age, 2) the role that a variety of individual differences play in claiming age intentions, and 3) interactions between interventions and individual differences on claiming age intentions. Per a preregistered design, we recruited 4,500 prescreened participants, and then analyzed intended claiming age as a linear function of the indicator variables, one for each treatment arm. We also tested each individual difference measure and 23 theoretically relevant preregistered interactions.

Here we examine an important downstream consequence of spending money on experiences: fostering social connection. In an initial experiment, consumers report feeling more kinship with someone who has made a similar experiential purchase than someone who has made a similar material purchase (or no similar purchase). This result is tied to the greater centrality of experiential purchases to the consumer's identity. A follow-up experiment explores whether the greater sense of social connection that experiences provide applies even in situations in which someone else has made a similar, but superior purchase-when negative comparisons to others are brought to mind. Next, we find that people feel more connected to others in general, not just those who have made the same purchase, when they reflect on their experiential consumption. We then demonstrate that these feelings of connection are behaviorally expressed in a greater desire to engage in social activities when participants are primed about their experiences than when primed about their possessions.", "endtime": "1:20 pm", "event_index": 860, "location": "JMHH 370", "owner": "Decision Processes Colloquia (Wharton)", "speaker": "Amit Kumar\nAssistant Professor, Marketing\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, McCombs School of Business", "starttime": " 12:00 ", "title": "The Aptly Buried \u201cI\u201d in Experience: Experiential Purchases Foster Social Connection", "url": "https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/events/dpcolloquia/"},

At the median owner-occupancy rate zip code, we find that a 1% increase in Airbnb listings leads to a 0.018% increase in rents and a 0.026% increase in house prices. Finally, we formally test whether the Airbnb effect is due to the reallocation of the housing supply.Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that, while the total supply of housing is not affected by the entry of Airbnb, Airbnb listings increase the supply of short-term rental units and decrease the supply of long-term rental units.", "endtime": "1:20 pm", "event_index": 864, "location": "JMHH 741 Conference Room (unless otherwise noted)", "owner": "Marketing Department Colloquia (Wharton)", "speaker": "Davide Proserpio", "starttime": " 12:00 noon ", "title": "Thursday, September 5, 2019 ~ Speaker: Davide Proserpio", "url": "https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/events/marketing-colloquia-2019-2020/"},

While these ads have excellent user-tracking properties through mobile device IDs, they have raised concerns among privacy advocates. This has resulted in an ongoing debate on the value of different types of targeting information, the incentives of ad-networks to engage in behavioral targeting, and the role of regulation. To answer these questions, we propose a unified modeling framework that consists of two components -a machine learning framework for targeting and an analytical auction model for examining market outcomes under counterfactual targeting regimes. We apply our framework to large-scale data from the leading in-app ad-network of an Asian country. We find that an efficient targeting policy based on our machine learning framework improves the average click-through rate by 66.80% over the current system. These gains mainly stem from behavioral information compared to contextual information. Theoretical and empirical counterfactuals show that while total surplus grows with more granular targeting, ad-network's revenues are non-monotonic, i.e., the most efficient targeting does not maximize ad-network revenues.Rather, it is maximized when the ad-network does not allow advertisers to engage in behavioral targeting. Our results suggest that ad-networks may have incentives to preserve users' privacy without external regulation.", "endtime": "1:20 pm", "event_index": 866, "location": "JMHH 741 Conference Room (unless otherwise noted)", "owner": "Marketing Department Colloquia (Wharton)", "speaker": "Hema Yoganarasimhan", "starttime": " 12:00 noon ", "title": "Wednesday, October 16, 2019 ~ Speaker: Hema Yoganarasimhan", "url": "https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/events/marketing-colloquia-2019-2020/"},

Extant research has examined behavior-based price discrimination (BBP), that is, how firms set different prices for repeat and new customers. This research extends the literature by investigating behavior-based quality discrimination to reveal the unique effects of quality discrimination beyond the effects of BBP. Using a two-period game-theoretic model, we find that firms reward repeat customers on the quality dimension by offering them higher-quality product features or services than what new customers receive. Such quality discrimination dissuades competitive poaching, softens second-period price competition, and increases second-period profits. Meanwhile, firms reward new customers on the price dimension by offering them a lower price than what repeat customers pay. Therefore, firms should reward different types of customers with the right attribute (i.e., product features or services versus price). In addition, quality discrimination increases customer retention in the second period. Anticipating this outcome, forward-looking firms reduce first-period prices to compete aggressively for initial customers. This effect intensifies first-period competition and reduces first-period profits.Overall, behavior-based quality discrimination decreases firms' total profits but increases consumer surplus and social welfare.", "endtime": "1:20 pm", "event_index": 867, "location": "JMHH 741 Conference Room (unless otherwise noted)", "owner": "Marketing Department Colloquia (Wharton)", "speaker": "Krista Li", "starttime": " 12:00 noon ", "title": "Thursday, October 24, 2019 ~ Speaker: Krista Li", "url": "https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/events/marketing-colloquia-2019-2020/"},

However, in standard models of sovereign default the main drivers of sovereign spreads are local conditions. This paper proposes a mechanism that can explain, at the same time, the high correlation of spreads and the low correlation of local conditions. The model features a large developed economy, which lends to a large number of developing economies, using long run bonds that can be defaulted on. The key feature of the model is the presence of long run risk (as in Bansal and Yaron, 2006). We first show that the model can account for the dynamics of several real variables and of sovereign spreads in the cross section of developing economies. We then use the model for examining how much of the fluctuations in spreads in developing economies arise from the changes in long risk in the developed economy (the price of risk), v/s changes in long run risk in the developing economies themselves (the quantity of risk). We find that 2/3 of fluctuations in spreads are explained by the quantity of risk.

We build on the capitalization approach in Saez and Zucman (2016) while accounting for heterogeneity within asset classes when mapping income flows to wealth. Our approach reduces bias in wealth estimates because wealth and rates of return are correlated. Overall, wealth is very concentrated: the top 1% holds as much wealth as the bottom 90%. However, the \"P90-99\" class holds more wealth than either group after accounting for heterogeneity. Relative to a top 0.1% wealth share of more than 20% under equal returns, we estimate a top 0.1% wealth share of [15%] and find that the rise since 1980 in top wealth shares falls by [half]. Top portfolios depend less on fixed income and public equity, depend more on private equity and housing, and more closely match the composition reported in the SCF and estate tax returns. Our adjustments reduce mechanical revenue estimates from a wealth tax and top capital income shares in distributional national accounts, which depend on well-measured estimates of top wealth. Though the capitalization approach has advantages over other methods of estimating top wealth, we emphasize that considerable uncertainty remains inherent to the approach by showing the sensitivity of estimates to different assumptions. * This work does not necessarily reflect the views of the US Treasury Department.

Using panel data covering 1998-2011, I find that the introduction of a European wide emission standard coincides with a 14% drop in emission ratings, of which 30% is explained by technology adoption and 70% by gaming. I estimate a structural model to find that the regulation missed its emission target and was not welfare improving. Abatement with sales-mixing would have reduced emissions, but at high costs.

We assemble a novel dataset that combines (i) detailed microdata on farmers' electricity consumption, (ii) rich data from technical audits of these farmers' pump efficiencies, and (iii) publicly available measurements of groundwater depths in California aquifers. Using exogenous variation in electricity prices, we estimate farmers' price elasticities of demand for both electricity (-1:17) and groundwater (1:12) to be much larger than previous estimates in the literature.

Instead, they increasingly rely on schemes that face less public resistance, such as driving restrictions or license-plate bans, notwithstanding the literature has shown they typically result in more congestion and pollution by encouraging the purchase of additional, older, and more polluting vehicles. With the help of a transport model calibrated to capture Santiago's current congestion and pollution reality, we advance a restriction proposal that prevents the purchase of additional vehicles while leaving consumers of all income groups better off: driving restrictions with toll and vintage exemptions, where the toll collection is spent in public-transport fare reductions and quality improvements. A driver of a restricted car has always the option to pay a toll (daily pass) to have it exempted, but as long as the car's pollution level is below a certain threshold. Under the more ambitious format ---five days restriction, 14 dollars toll, and 2000 and 2005 vintage thresholds for petrol and diesel, respectively--- per-year net benefits from lighter traffic and cleaner air amount to 1200 million dollars (almost 0.5% of the country's GDP).", "endtime": "09:00 PM", "event_index": 892, "location": "Kleinman Center classroom\u2014Fisher Fine Arts Room 306", "owner": "Energy Economics & Finance Seminar", "speaker": "CANCELED: Juan Pablo Montero (PUC-Chile)", "starttime": "08:00 PM", "title": "CANCELED: Juan Pablo Montero (PUC-Chile)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/energy-economics-finance-seminar/"},

We combine a unique dataset, which details search behavior for a large sample of mortgage borrowers, with loan application and rejection decisions. Our data reveal substantial dispersion in mortgage rates and search intensity, conditional on observables.  However, in contrast to predictions of standard search models, we find a novel non-monotonic relationship between search and realized prices: borrowers, who search a lot, obtain more expensive mortgages than borrowers' with less frequent search. The evidence suggests that this occurs because lenders screen borrowers' creditworthiness, rejecting unworthy borrowers, which differentiates consumer credit markets from other search markets. Based on these insights, we build a model that combines search and screening in presence of asymmetric information.  Risky borrowers internalize the probability that their application is rejected, and behave as if they had higher search costs.  The model rationalizes the positive relationship between search and interest rates, and highlights the tight link between credit standards and pricing. We estimate the parameters of the model and study several counterfactuals. The model suggests that _overpayment_ may be a poor proxy for consumer unsophistication since it partly represents rational search in presence of rejections. Moreover, the development of improved screening technologies from an abundance of data endogenously leads to more severe adverse selection in credit markets.  Finally, place based policies, such as the Community Reinvestment Act, may affect equilibrium prices through endogenous search responses rather than increased credit risk.", "endtime": "09:00 PM", "event_index": 907, "location": "The Ronald O.

The framework's usefulness and theoretical founding make it a valuable starting point for analyzing misallocations. However, we show this approach is sensitive to model misspecification. The model's mapping from observed production behaviors to isallocative wedges/distortions holds in a single theoretical case, with strict assumptions required on both the demand and supply sides. We demonstrate that applying the HK methodology when there is any deviation from these assumptions will mean \"distortions\" recovered from the data may not be signs of inefficiency. Rather, they may simply reflect demand shifts or movements of the firm along its marginal cost curve, quite possibly in profitable directions. The framework may then not just spuriously identify inefficiencies; it might be more likely to do so precisely for businesses better in some fundamental way than their competitors. Empirical tests in our data, which allow us to separate price and quantity and as such directly test the model's assumptions, suggest the framework's necessary conditions do not hold. We then extend the HK framework to allow for more general demand and supply structures to quantify the discrepancy between the framework and the data. We find substantial deviations, particularly on the demand side. Using a decomposition derived from our extended framework, we find that much of the variation in revenue-based TFP (the measure of distortions in HK) reflects the influence of demand shifts, either directly or through distortions correlated with those shifts. We furthermore show that under general conditions, the variance of revenue-based TFP is not a sufficient statistic for efficiency losses due to misallocation.\u00a0", "endtime": "09:00 PM", "event_index": 910, "location": "The Ronald O.

Further, a model that omits consumer inertia tends to overstate the marginal effect of competition on price, relative to a benchmark that accounts for consumer dynamics.

I use a dynamic spatial equilibrium framework and detailed georeferenced data from Vietnam to examine this issue and find evidence that coastal favouritism has significant costs. Road investments concentrated in coastal regions between 2000 and 2010 had positive returns but would have been outperformed by allocations concentrated further inland even in the absence of sea level rise. Future inundation renders the status quo significantly less efficient.

This paper provides an analysis of state-sponsored auto-enrollment plans and how their default contribution rates affect employee saving behavior. OregonSaves is a plan that mandates employers to provide access to OregonSaves if they offer no employer-sponsored plan. Using these data, we show that about half of workers provided access to OregonSaves participate, and around three-quarters of participants save at the default 5% contribution rate. We also develop a model of the optimal default contribution rate using an empirically implementable sufficient statistics framework. The optimal default rate is shaped by the marginal welfare internality of savings due to the underestimation of future utility, and the marginal welfare internality of action due to the overestimation of the cost of switching to a non-default saving option. We also discuss the implications of default saving policies taking into account Social Security and means-tested social transfers. Reduced form calculations suggest that saving in OregonSaves will reduce annual expenditures on means-tested benefits by about $2 billion.\u00a0\u00a0", "endtime": "05:30 PM", "event_index": 922, "location": "265 JMHH", "owner": "Applied Economics Workshop (Wharton)", "speaker": "Mingli Zhong (Applied Economics)", "starttime": "04:00 PM", "title": "Mingli Zhong (Applied Economics)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/"},

The consumer's utility is additive in the different categories, and her preferences about product attributes as well as her price sensitivity vary across products. Her preferences are correlated across products. We build on techniques from the machine learning literature on probabilistic models of matrix factorization, extending the methods to account for time-varying product attributes, a more realistic functional form for price sensitivity, and products going out of stock. We incorporate the information about the product hierarchy, so that consumers are assumed to select at most one alternative within a category. We show that our model improves over traditional modeling approaches that consider each category in isolation, when we evaluate the ability of the model to predict responsiveness to price changes (using held-out data from a large number of price changes that occurred in our sample). We show that one source of the improvement is the ability of the model to accurately estimate heterogeneity in preferences (by pooling information across categories); another source of improvement is its ability to estimate the preferences of consumers who have rarely or never made a purchase in a given category in the training data.

As a result, coverage of such services is least valuable in the states of the world in which marginal utility is greatest -- an anti-insurance effect.  Whether the net effect of health insurance is to improve or worsen risk exposure depends on the insured's relative exposure to health versus non-health risks.

I leverage novel social security administrative data on the universe\u00a0 of survivor insurance payments in Italy, and useful quasi-experimental variation in the benefits received by surviving spouses on the basis of their spouse's death date. I implement a regression discontinuity design in spousal death date to identify the effect of unearned income on labor supply, earnings and program substitution. Benefit losses trigger tantamount increases in earned income, implying a marginal propensity to earn out of unearned income of approximately -1. Extensive-margin responses - in the form of both increased labor-market entry by younger survivors and delayed retirement by older survivors - emerge as the main driving force behind the income response. Program substitution also appears to be a relevant margin of adjustment. I consider alternative explanations for the large income response. Finally, I discuss the normative implications of my findings. I propose a revealed-preference approach to estimate the value\u00a0 of transfers based on participation responses.

The Case of Unlimited Vacation\nABSTRACT: This paper addresses the birth of risky perks that endow flexibility and autonomy to workers in startup companies. While potentially offering recruitment and performance benefits to firms, these perks also come with two types of risks--agency risks due to the possibility of abuse as well as social risks that may limit the extent of gains. Focusing on an increasingly popular perk--unlimited vacation, this paper adopts a multi-method approach and ask: Does unlimited vacation benefit firms, and how? What can firms do to minimize the risks? Motivated by a content analysis, I develop a theoretical model that formalizes conjectures about the micro-foundations for using unlimited vacation to maximize the value of human assets. Predictions are tested in two studies. Study 1 conducts a randomized controlled experiment with an online labor market through a one-month job. In a 2x3x2 design, I vary (i) worker ability (high or low) (ii) work contract (unlimited vacation, capped vacation, or a choice between the two), and (iii) firing threat (strong or weak). I find that unlimited vacation (1) is three times more attractive to high ability workers, (2) increases worker productivity by 20-30%, or 51% when bundled with other practices, and (3) induces extra outputs from happier workers. An organizational system with a strong firing threat reduces slacking rate by 45%. Study 2 confirms the recruitment and performance benefits using a panel of employee survey and vacation data from a large technology firm. In addition, I find that supportive social dynamics (i.e., team and manager relationships) strengthen the gains in the performance stage.

We estimate that a one-percentage-point reduction in filing risk within a credit score segment translates to a 67 basis-point decline in the offered interest rate for unsecured credit. Based on a simple model of interest rate setting, this represents approximately 73% pass-through relative to a perfect competition benchmark.

Much of it is spent through \\scaling\" procurement auctions, in which private construction firms submit unit price bids for each piece of material required to complete a project. The winner is determined by the lowest total cost|given government estimates of the amount of each material needed|but, critically, they are paid based on the realized quantities used. This creates an incentive for firms to skew their bids|bidding high when they believe the government is underestimating an item's quantity and vice versa|and raises concerns of rent-extraction among policymakers. For risk averse bidders, however, scaling auctions provide a distinctive way to generate surplus: they enable firms to limit their risk exposure by placing lower unit bids on items with greater uncertainty. To assess this effect empirically, we develop a structural model of scaling auctions with risk averse bidders. Using data on bridge maintenance projects undertaken by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT), we present evidence that bidding behavior is consistent with optimal skewing under risk aversion. We then estimate bidders' risk aversion, the risk in each auction, and the distribution of bidders' private costs. Finally, we simulate equilibrium item-level bids under counterfactual settings to estimate the fraction of MassDOT spending that is due to risk and evaluate alternative mechanisms under consideration by MassDOT. We find that scaling auctions provide substantial savings to MassDOT relative to lump sum auctions and suggest several policies that might improve on the status quo.", "endtime": "06:30 PM", "event_index": 943, "location": "265 JMHH", "owner": "Applied Economics Workshop (Wharton)", "speaker": "Shoshana Vasserman (Harvard)", "starttime": "05:00 PM", "title": "Shoshana Vasserman (Harvard)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/"},

Conversely, strong property rights over innovations can impede cumulative research and lead to inefficient duplication of effort. These effects are particularly acute in natural resource exploration, where discoveries are spatially correlated and property rights over neighboring regions are allocated to competing firms. I use data from offshore oil exploration in the UK to quantify the effects of information externalities on the speed and efficiency of exploration by estimating a dynamic structural model of the firm's exploration problem. Firms drill exploration wells to learn about the spatial distribution of oil and face a trade-off between drilling now and delaying exploration to learn from other firms' wells. I show that removing the incentive to free ride brings exploration forward by about 1 year and increases industry surplus by 31%. Allowing perfect information flow between firms raises industry surplus by a further 38%. Counterfactual policy simulations highlight the trade off between discouraging free riding and encouraging cumulative research - stronger property rights over exploration well data increase the rate of exploration, while weaker property rights increase the efficiency and speed of learning but reduce the rate of exploration. Spatial clustering of each firm's drilling licenses both reduces the incentive to free ride and increases the speed of learning", "endtime": "06:30 PM", "event_index": 949, "location": "265 JMHH", "owner": "Applied Economics Workshop (Wharton)", "speaker": "Charles Hodgson (Stanford)", "starttime": "05:00 PM", "title": "Charles Hodgson (Stanford)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/"},

I find that previously inaccessible areas add twice as many net new restaurants in the post period than in the pre-period, boosting net creation rates from 4% to 8%. I find no response in industries less sensitive to travel choice, such as dentists or dry cleaners. These results are robust to a variety of inaccessibility definitions, are not driven by the most public transit reliant cities, and show no evidence of industry dispersion in the pre-period. As these areas become more productive and desirable, house prices rise by 11-15% on average, as firms and residents compete for newly desirable locations. Tracking travel patterns, emissions increase by 11% in formerly inaccessible areas, and in New York City, travelers are 9% more likely to be dropped off by taxi in inaccessible locations; both consistent with consumers' substituting away from public transit in favor of private cars to access new locations. Put together, a 9-11% increase in travel is associated with a 4% additional growth in restaurants. I frame these reduced form results using a modified spatial equilibrium framework, in which resident welfare depends on the trade-off between accessibility benefits and housing costs.

We propose a hypothesis to reconcile these two trends: that when they are making key human capital decisions, women in modern cohorts underestimate the impact of motherhood on their future labor supply. Using an event-study framework, we show substantial and persistent employment effects of motherhood in U.K. and U.S. data. We then provide evidence that women do not anticipate these effects. Upon becoming parents, women (and especially more educated women) adopt more negative views toward female employment (e.g., they are more likely to say that women working hurts family life), suggesting that motherhood serves as an information shock to their beliefs. Women on average (and, again, more educated women in particular) report that parenthood is harder than they expected. We then look at longer horizons--are young women's expectations about future labor supply correct when they make their key educational decisions? In fact, female high school seniors are increasingly and substantially overestimating the likelihood they will be in the labor market in their thirties, a sharp reversal from previous cohorts who substantially underestimated their future labor supply. Finally, we specify a model of women's choice of educational investment in the face of uncertain employment costs of motherhood, which demonstrates that our results can be reconciled only if these costs increased unexpectedly across generations.

We investigate the extent of these disincentives over the recipients' lifetime using newly collected administrative data for about 16,000 women from the Mother's Pension Program, the first welfare program in the US. We find that welfare receipt does not affect lifetime remarriage rates but delays marriage by a year. Although theory predicts delays should be associated with improvements in the quality of the match, we find no changes in the quality of the matches. Also contrary to theory, we find no changes in the lifetime fertility and work behavior of the mother. We do find that recipients were less likely to move away from their county of residence.

We investigate the introduction as well as the repeal of a regulatory change; \"mandatory minimum annuity rules\" using a laboratory experiment and two surveys.  Our results indicate that imposing a mandatory minimum may create an anchoring effect to the threshold level. Furthermore, our results suggest that the mandatory requirement may have unintended consequences: such laws may fail to provide an increase in the demand for annuities and may even reduce it for certain individuals.  The outcome is sensitive to the relation between the level of the mandatory minimum and anticipated consumption (i.e., future financial need). Moreover, we provide new evidence about the consequences of a repeal of mandatory minimum annuity laws, suggesting that it may not restore the demand for annuities to the pre-law level.\u00a0", "endtime": "05:30 PM", "event_index": 954, "location": "265 JMHH", "owner": "Applied Economics Workshop (Wharton)", "speaker": "Abigail Hurwitz (Hebrew University)", "starttime": "04:00 PM", "title": "Abigail Hurwitz (Hebrew University)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/"},

While there is a vast literature on UI, SP programs have received much less attention, even though they are prevalent across countries and predominant in developing countries. In particular, little is known about the insurance value that they provide to displaced workers, which critically relies on workers' ability to optimally dissave their lump-sum amount after layoff. We follow a standard approach in the UI literature that evaluates workers' need for insurance and the insurance value of policies by studying workers' consumption profile after layoff. We exploit a rare combination of de-identified high-frequency expenditure data and matched employee-employer data in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, where displaced workers are eligible for both UI and SP. Our main finding is that workers increase consumption at layoff by 35% despite experiencing a long-term consumption loss of 17% when they stop receiving any benefits. We refer to ``consumption'' because these patterns are robust across expenditure categories, and are not driven by durable goods. Moreover, the excess sensitivity of consumption to cash-on-hand is present across a rich set of policy variation in UI benefits and SP amounts. We show that a simple dynamic model of job search and consumption with present-bias agents is consistent with both reemployment and consumption patterns in our data. We then use this model to illustrate the usual incentive-insurance trade-off under counterfactual job displacement insurance designs. Our findings highlight the importance of the difference between SP and UI in their disbursement policy when consumption is highly sensitive to the timing of benefit payment -- beyond their different contingency policy -- and shed new light on the need for job displacement insurance in a developing country context.\u00a0", "endtime": "06:30 PM", "event_index": 959, "location": "265 JMHH", "owner": "Applied Economics Workshop (Wharton)", "speaker": "Joana Naritomi (LSE)", "starttime": "05:00 PM", "title": "Joana Naritomi (LSE)", "url": "https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/"},

To overcome the fact that factors that affect a worker's outside options may also impact her productivity at her current job, we develop a strategy that isolates changes in a worker's information about her outside options. This strategy relies on the fact that individuals often learn about jobs through social networks, including former coworkers. We implement this strategy using employer-employee data from Denmark that contain monthly information on wages and detailed measures of worker skills. We find that increases in labor demand at former coworkers' current firms lead to job-to-job mobility and wage growth. Consistent with theory, larger changes are necessary to induce a job-to-job transition than to induce a wage gain. Specification tests leveraging alternative sources of variation suggest these responses are indeed due to information rather than unobserved demand shocks.

We exploit a policy in Chile that lowered interest rate caps by 20 percentage points to understand its impacts. Using comprehensive individual-level administrative data, we document that the policy decreased transacted interest rates by 9%, but also reduced the number of loans by 19%. To estimate the welfare effects of this policy, we develop and estimate a model of loan applications, pricing, and repayment of loans. Consumer surplus decreases by an equivalent of 3.5% of average income, with larger losses for risky borrowers.

Our principal challenge was to overcome the seeming contradiction that a Z_2 action used to break symmetry to that of the Standard Model in the Heterotic model and still yield a Calabi-Yau fourfold on the F-theory side seemed to break F-theory symmetry in a way that is incompatible with that of the Standard Model. With considerable guidance from Dave Morrison, Sakura Sch\u00e4fer-Nameki, and Tony Pantev, we were finally led to overcome this difficulty by re-examining two peices of the puzzle: 1) the Narasihham-Seshadri equivalence that equates flat E_8(real) bundles with flat complex holomorphic complex E_8(complex) vector bundles on a Riemann surface, 2) the properties of the Tate form that govern the evolution of symmetry-breaking from the initial E_8 x E_8 state that allow the Tate form (with the help of the Jacobson-Morosov theorem) to uniquely determine an explicit deformation of the E_8 rational double-point singularity. We notice in 1) that there are actually two (conjugate) complex structures that can be assigned to the given real bundle, With repect to 2) we apply the Brieskorn-Grothendieck equivariant crepant resolution of the E_8 rational double-point singularity.

This figure has steadily crept up over the last decade. Yet, even as nearly a third of employed Americans depend on this \u201ccontingent employment\u201d, these ad-hoc \u201cjobs\u201d are woefully under addressed by contemporary labor laws. Consequentially, a large swarth of American workers are forced to depend on severely inequitable employment relationships which can be terminated at the whim of the gig company, often with little or no explanation.\nThis situation is untenable. To this end, this talk aims to offer two potential avenues for agitating for better legal protections and work cultures for those who participate in gig work. I begin by detailing my own participation as a named plaintiff in\u00a0Singer et al. v Postmates, which put $8 million back in the hands of gig workers who we, the plaintiffs, alleged had been misclassified as \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d Although Postmates settled, and thus, we were unsuccessful in challenging the lack of legal protections afforded gig workers, it was certainly not painless nor inexpensive for the company.\nFollowing this brief summary of\u00a0Singer et al v. Postmates, I then turn my attention to the carework site, Care.com. Because Uber often stands in as a (male) synecdoche for the totality of the gig economy (Ticona, Mateescu, Rosenblatt 2018), examining carework offers an important expansion of both the breadth of work that gig workers engage in as well as showing how intersectional inequalities persist even when supposedly \u201cone is their own boss.\u201d Through an analysis of approximately 3500 postings on multiple review sites such as TrustPilot and the Better Business Bureau, a picture of the recurring issues faced by careworkers is revealed. In addition, because it is in the interest of gig companies to hide their unethical practices, these reviews are oftentimes the only way that these grievances can be aired and made publicly visible (Bishop 2019). Although this research is still in a very preliminary stage, troubling trends are already apparent; namely, deactivation of a careworker\u2019s account without reason and the likelihood that Care.com is engaging in the Ashley Madison-esque practice of populating their site with fake profiles (both job seekers and job providers).\nIt is my hope that in describing the working conditions of gig workers in each of these spaces, we can then segue into a dialogue about how to make one\u2019s scholarship as efficacious as possible in effecting real-world change beyond the walls of the academy.", "endtime": "1:00pm", "event_index": 1062, "location": "ASC Room 223", "owner": "Annenberg School of Communication", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00pm", "title": "MARC Works-in-Progress Workshop with Ryan Tsapatsaris", "url": "https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/events/marc-works-progress-workshop-0"},

Using our model, we demonstrate how not taking into account the agent's preference for early (late) resolution of uncertainty would lead an analyst to underestimate (resp., overestimate) the agent's risk aversion. Estimation of preferences can be performed by the analyst without explicitly modeling continuation problems (i.e. stochastic choice is independent of continuation menus) if and only if the utility pro- * We want to thank Andy Atkeson, Simon Board, Mira Frick, Faruk Gul, Ryota Iijima, Asen Kochov, Rosa Matzkin, Tomasz Strzalecki, John Rust, Yi Xing and seminar audiences at the University of Rochester, the 18th SAET Conference at Academia Sinica, CIREQ Montreal Microeconomic Theory Conference, Georgetown University, the University of Maryland, the University of Montreal, the University of Michigan, London School of Economics, Yale University, the Los Angeles Theory Conference, the Caltech Junior Theory Workshop and the Risk, Uncertainty and Decision Conference at the Paris School of Economics for their helpful comments.

In countries with large declining agricultural sectors, aggregate employment is uncorrelated with GDP. During booms, employment in agriculture declines while labor productivity increases in agriculture more than in other sectors. We construct a unified theory of business cycles and structural change consistent with the stylized facts. The focal point of the theory is the simultaneous decline and modernization of agriculture. As capital accumulates, agriculture becomes increasingly capital intensive as modern agriculture crowds out traditional agriculture. Structural change accelerates in booms and slows down in recessions.

The FLM generalizes Luce's model and naturally captures bounded rationality models while behaviorally distinguishing between what is focal and the magnitude of the bias due to focality. We show how to identify utilities, focal sets, and bias terms from choice frequencies and behaviorally found the FLM with two weakenings of independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA) which account for the decision maker's revealed focus. We introduce a new condition on focal sets, Conditionally Decreasing, which captures an increasing difficulty of focusing on multiple alternative and encompasses several models of limited consideration.

This self-aligning geometry provides a wider range of acceptable error tolerance in relative pose between the two rigid objects, increasing successful docking chances. In a broader context, mechanical alignment properties are also useful for other cases such as foot placement and stability, grasping or manipulation. Previously, computational limitations and costly algorithms prevented high-dimensional analysis. The algorithms presented in this talk will show a reduced computational time and improved resolution for this kind of problem.\nThis dissertation will review multiple methods for evaluating modular robot connector geometries as a case study in determining alignment properties. Several metrics are introduced in terms of the robustness of the alignment to errors across the full dimensional range of possible offsets. Algorithms for quantifying error robustness will be introduced and compared in terms of accuracy, reliability, and computational cost. Connector robustness is then compared across multiple design parameters to find trends in alignment behavior.
