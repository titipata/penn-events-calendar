At the core of this theory lie two unanswered questions: what is the nature of the brain\u2019s internal model, and how are probability distributions of variables in this model represented? Previous research often takes a \u201cforward engineering\u201d approach to these questions, assuming a model family and inference algorithm and mapping the inference dynamics, theoretically or empirically, onto neural circuits. My research has instead been driven by a \u201creverse engineering\u201d approach, making empirical predictions for Bayesian inference in perception that are not committed to a particular model family or inference algorithm. I will show how a highly general descriptive model of probabilistic representation is sufficient to make testable predictions for a general class of \u201cposterior coding\u201d representations, specifically for neural and behavioral patterns in the common two-alternative forced-choice discrimination paradigm, and I will present new data from both domains. **Please note that this seminar will begin at 11:45am.

However, in many cases it has been difficult to convincingly justify the choices of the model parameters (i.e. the likelihood functions and prior beliefs) needed to explain the data. I will demonstrate how we used the efficient coding hypothesis to derive a new and better constrained formulation of the Bayesian observer model. The new model makes a set of rather surprising and counter-intuitive predictions that, however, are supported both by neural and psychophysical data. I will discuss the general implications of the new framework for our understanding of perceptual inference.A pizza lunch will be served.", "endtime": "12:30 PM", "event_id": "", "location": "Barchi Library (140 John Morgan Building)", "owner": "Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI)", "speaker": " Alan Stocker", "starttime": "11:30 AM", "summary": "", "title": "CNI Seminar: Alan Stocker", "url": "https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-alan-stocker", "date_dt": "15-10-2019", "event_index": 1},

My argument is in three parts. The first focuses on the rise of mathematically based astrology in 5th- and 4th-century Babylon. I suggest that, after a period of resistance against Persian rule under Darius and Xerxes, Chaldean astrology emerged from a new climate of collaboration and assimilation under the later Achaemenids. I then look at developments after the fall of the Persian empire: Seleucus of Seleucia (ca. 150 BCE), I argue, exemplifies a period of exceptionally fertile intellectual crosspollination, when leading Chaldeans drew on Babylonian datasets and observational techniques to intervene in Greek philosophical debates. The final part of my paper addresses the crisis of Chaldean philosophy that resulted from the rise of Platonism, and its remodeling along Platonic lines in the Antonine period.\n", "endtime": "6:00pm", "event_id": "", "location": "402 Cohen Hall", "owner": "Department of Classical Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "4:30pm", "summary": "", "title": "COLLOQUIUM: Johannes Haubold, Princeton, \"The development of Chaldean philosophy between the fifth century BCE and the second century CE\"", "url": "https://www.classics.upenn.edu/events/colloquium-johannes-haubold-princeton-development-chaldean-philosophy-between-fifth-century", "date_dt": "17-10-2019", "event_index": 167},

The contents of most of these philosophical and scientific texts were sufficiently abstract that the cultural divide between the Graeco-Roman past and the Iraqi present posed few problems for a translator versed in technical Greek. Yet there were notable exceptions. This talk focuses on the ways in which one group of ninth-century Christian translators\u2014the circle around \u1e24unayn ibn Is\u1e25\u0101q\u2014systematically alter or remove references to the \u2018pagan\u2019 gods of Greece and Rome when translating the second-century-CE Greek medical writer Galen for a Muslim and Christian readership.

    {"date": "EDT October 21", "description": "Abstract: Over 4.5 million people in the United States have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, yet only 50% of HCV-infected individuals are diagnosed and ~15% receive curative treatment. HCV-related stigma has been identified as an important and understudied barrier to HCV care. Stigma is a social-process, linking individual attributes/behaviors to negative stereotypes. Stigma in healthcare is associated with poor health outcomes and decreased quality of life. Moreover, healthcare stigmas may intersect with stigmas of other personal attributes, intensifying patient experiences of disease-related stigma and social marginalization. To date, no validated and standardized instrument exists to measure perceptions of stigma among patients with chronic HCV infection, limiting efforts to identify, measure, and intervene upon the impact of stigma. To address existing knowledge gaps, we conducted an explanatory mixed-methods study across five Philadelphia healthcare clinics to: 1) revise and validate the Berger HIV Stigma Scale- a validated HIV stigma measure- for use among patients with HCV; 2) identify factors associated with HCV-related stigma; and 3) connect subjective experience of HCV-related stigma to HCV Stigma Scale (HCV-SS) scores. Our mixed-methods approach included a cross-sectional survey instrument (n=270) and semi-structured interviews among a subset of participants (n=23) who completed the survey instrument. We evaluated the validity of the HCV-SS using factor analysis and item response theory. Analyses evidenced a unidimensional factor solution, yielding a 33-item scale with good reliability (\uf061=0.957) and construct validity. Qualitative content validity analyses identified additional salient themes that inform HCV-related stigma experiences, chiefly familial support and associated injection drug-use stigma. We then used multivariable linear regression to analyze associations among HCV-related stigma and hypothesized demographic, behavioral, and clinical determinants. We hypothesized that additional stigmatized attributes, such as HIV coinfection and history of injection drug use, may augment experiences of HCV-related stigma. We found that most participants experienced stigma associated with their HCV diagnosis. Determinants of HCV-related stigma differed substantially between HCV-monoinfected and HCV/HIV-coinfected participants. The generation of a validated and standardized scale to measure HCV-related stigma and identify determinants improves understandings of stigma experienced by patients with HCV-infection, which can inform interventions to increase rates of HCV diagnosis and treatment.\u00a0\n\n\nDissertation Advisors: Vincent Lo Re, III, MD, MSCE\u00a0\n\n\nCommittee Chair: John Holmes, PhD, FACE, FACMI\u00a0\n\n\nCommittee: Fran Barg, PhD, MeD, Nandita Mitra, PhD, Julie Szymczak, PhD, Jason Schnittker, PhD", "endtime": " 1:00pm", "event_id": "", "location": "Class of 62\u2019 Auditorium, John Morgan Building, 3620 Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00pm ", "summary": "", "title": "GGEB Dissertation Defense: M.

Available information in this scenario commonly includes longitudinal measurements from the same subject. Since future information is unknown and may develop dynamically over time, such a predictive problem is challenging. We consider a predictive approach based on modeling the forward intensity function. The forward intensity function approach is appealing for being capable of intrinsically incorporating the future dynamics that affect the stochastic event occurrence. To handle the practical difficulty due to the missing data in the longitudinal measurements, and to accommodate observations at irregularly spaced time points, we propose a smoothed composite likelihood approach for estimating the forward intensity model. Our theoretical analysis establishes the validity of the predictive modeling approach and the smoothed composite likelihood method. Extensive simulations and real data analysis demonstrate the promising performance of the predictive approach.

    {"date": "EDT October 29", "description": "Title: Back to the Basics: Residuals and Diagnostics for Generalized Linear Models\n\nAbstract: Ordinal outcomes are common in scientific research and everyday practice, and we often rely on regression models to make inference. A long-standing problem with such regression analyses is the lack of effective diagnostic tools for validating model assumptions. The difficulty arises from the fact that an ordinal variable has discrete values that are labeled with, but not, numerical values. The values merely represent ordered categories. In this paper, we propose a surrogate approach to defining residuals for an ordinal outcome Y. The idea is to define a continuous variable S as a \u201csurrogate\u201d of Y and then obtain residuals based on S. For the general class of cumulative link regression models, we study the residual\u2019s theoretical and graphical properties. We show that the residual has null properties similar to those of the common residuals for continuous outcomes. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the residual has power to detect misspecification with respect to 1) mean structures; 2) link functions; 3) heteroscedasticity; 4) proportionality; and 5) mixed populations. The proposed residual also enables us to develop numeric measures for goodness-of-fit using classical distance notions. Our results suggest that compared to a previously defined residual, our residual can reveal deeper insights into model diagnostics. We stress that this work focuses on residual analysis, rather than hypothesis testing. The latter has limited utility as it only provides a single p-value, whereas our residual can reveal what components of the model are mis specified and advise how to make improvements.\n\n\n  This is a joint work with Dungang Liu, University of Cincinnati Lindner College of Business.", "endtime": " 4:30pm", "event_id": "", "location": "701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "3:30pm ", "summary": "", "title": "Biostatistics Seminar Series - Heping Zhang, PhD", "url": "http://events.med.upenn.edu/cceb/#!view/event/event_id/710452", "date_dt": "29-10-2019", "event_index": 268},

She has conducted studies that have identified high levels of substandard health behavior engagement among adults with CKD and phenotypes of behavior engagement that associate with clinical outcomes in this population. Her present work includes assessing for real-time barriers to self-management health behaviors by interviewing patients with CKD and developing a patient-centered behavioral intervention that leverages mobile health technology to increase engagement in healthy behaviors. She will conduct its feasibility in a clinical trial. Dr. Schrauben is moving into the area of implementation science in order to address implementation gaps in evidence-based CKD care. Her future work aims to guide the development of innovative strategies to improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes in CKD.\n\n\nDr. Schrauben received her undergraduate degree in Human Biology with a specialization in Health Promotion from Michigan State University, and her medical degree from the College of Human Medicine at Michigan State University. She completed Internal Medicine residency training, and a fellowship in Nephrology at the University of Pennsylvania. She also received a Master\u2019s of Science in Clinical Epidemiology from the University of Pennsylvania.", "endtime": " 10:00am", "event_id": "", "location": "Blockley Hall, 19104", "owner": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "9:00am ", "summary": "", "title": "CCEB Seminar-Sarah Schrauben, MD, MSCE", "url": "http://events.med.upenn.edu/cceb/#!view/event/event_id/711958", "date_dt": "31-10-2019", "event_index": 269},
    {"date": "November 5", "description": "Title: Defining and addressing dependent observation schemes in life history studies\n\nAbstract: Multistate models provide a powerful framework for the analysis of life history\n  processes when the goal is to\u00a0characterize transition intensities, transition probabilities, state occupancy probabilities, and covariate\u00a0effects thereon. \u00a0Data on such processes are often only available at random visit times occurring over a finite\u00a0period. \u00a0We formulate a joint multistate model for the life history process, the recurrent visit process,\u00a0and a random loss to follow-up time at which the visit process terminates. \u00a0This joint model is helpful when\u00a0discussing the independence conditions necessary to justify the use of standard likelihoods involving the life\u00a0history model alone and provides a basis for analyses that accommodate dependence. \u00a0We consider settings with\u00a0disease-driven visits occur in combination with routinely scheduled visits and develop likelihoods that accommodate partial information on the types of visits. \u00a0Simulation studies suggest that suitably constructed joint models can\u00a0yield consistent estimates of parameters of interest in the presence of dependent visit processes; identifiability\u00a0and estimability. issues are also discussed. The biases from intermittent observation of time-dependent covariates\u00a0will also be considered along with a multistate approach to mitigating this bias through joint modeling. Two applications will illustrate the benefits of joint modeling disease and observation processes.", "endtime": " 4:30pm", "event_id": "", "location": "701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "3:30pm ", "summary": "", "title": "Biostatistics Seminar Series - Richard J.

    {"date": "Oct 10 2019", "description": "Is the process of state building a unilateral, national venture, or is it something more collaborative, taking place in the interstices between adjoining countries? To answer this question, this book\u00a0takes a comparative look at the state building process along China, Myanmar, and Thailand's common borderland area. It shows that the variations in state building among these neighboring countries are the result of an interactive process that occurs across national boundaries. Departing from existing approaches that look at such processes from the angle of singular, bounded territorial states, the book argues that a more fruitful method is to examine how state and nation building in one country can influence, and be influenced by, the same processes across borders. It argues that the success or failure of one country's state building is a process that extends beyond domestic factors such as war preparation, political institutions, and geographic and demographic variables. Rather, it shows that we should conceptualize state building as an interactive process heavily influenced by a \"neighborhood effect.\" Furthermore, the book moves beyond the academic boundaries that divide arbitrarily China studies and Southeast Asian studies by providing an analysis that ties the state and nation building processes in China with those of Southeast Asia.\nEnze Han is\u00a0an Associate Professor at the Department of Politics and Public Administration at the University of Hong Kong.

The workshop will convene at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for the Study of Contemporary China (CSCC) on Saturday, October 26, 2019. CHAIR brings young IR scholars together to share their latest research related to China, build a professional network, and strengthen the academic community that focuses on China and IR topics. CHAIR is also the ideal venue for participants to present revised versions of papers from APSA\u2019s summer 2019 meeting or rough drafts of papers for ISA\u2019s spring 2020 convention. CSCC will reimburse participants up to $500 for accommodation and travel expenses. The bulk of our applications tends to come from the United States and Canada, but we are open to applicants from around the world (those traveling from beyond the US East Coast may be eligible for additional funding).\nWe are looking for approximately ten participants to present works that are part of their dissertations or that they intend to publish. Paper topics span the entire range of the IR sub-field, and abstracts will be chosen based on their level of development, fit with other submissions as part of a cohesive session, and representation of diverse perspectives, methodologies, and institutions. The day-long workshop will consist of four thematically-organized sessions, each comprised of 2-3 presenters and a discussant. Each presenter need only offer a\u00a0brief\u00a0overview of the paper (~5 minutes), to be followed by the discussant\u2019s short, detailed comments on all the papers (~15 minutes). The majority of each session will be devoted to discussion open to all the participants.\u00a0We expect all participants to have read the papers before the workshop, so that workshop discussions on the day can be as fruitful and productive as possible.\nCHAIR offers an opportunity to build a community of young IR scholars who study China, and there will be ample time for socializing throughout the day.

Can China and the United States avoid the Thucydides Trap as China rises?\u00a0\u00a0Allison\u2019s study leads one to conclude that such is not likely.\u00a0\u00a0Highlighting the importance of a number of different/additional variables than Allison\u2019s study focuses on, the analysis offered in this talk is not much more optimistic.\u00a0\u00a0It highlights eight reasons China and the US will find it difficult to avoid the Thucydides Trap: the bilateral strategic trust deficit, lack of agreement on the nature of the US pivot and US Indo-Pacific Strategy, recent trends in China\u2019s maritime policies, disagreements over cyber security, the US-China trade row, security dynamics underlying China\u2019s Anti-Access/Area Denial and Washington\u2019s AirSea Battle strategies, recent trends in Sino-Russian strategic alignment, and Washington\u2019s concerns about China\u2019s increased defense spending and growing military capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Moore argues that these eight factors will make it difficult to avoid a Sino-US conflict (hot or cold) in the coming decade, while leaving more room for the role of agency, or good diplomacy, than does Allison\u2019s approach.\nGregory J.

    {"date": "Nov 20 2019", "description": "The rise of major metropolises across China since the 1990s has been a double-edged sword: although big cities function as economic powerhouses, concentrated urban growth can worsen regional inequalities, governance challenges, and social tensions. Wary of these dangers, China\u2019s national leaders have tried to forestall top-heavy urbanization. However, urban and regional development policies at the subnational level have not always followed suit.\u00a0China\u2019s Urban Champions\u00a0explores the development paths of different provinces and asks why policymakers in many cases favor big cities in a way that reinforces spatial inequalities rather than reducing\u00a0them.\nKyle Jaros combines in-depth case studies of Hunan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Jiangsu provinces with quantitative analysis to shed light on the political drivers of uneven development. Drawing on numerous Chinese-language written sources, including government documents and media reports, as well as a wealth of field interviews with officials, policy experts, urban planners, academics, and businesspeople, Jaros shows how provincial development strategies are shaped by both the horizontal relations of competition among different provinces and the vertical relations among different tiers of government. Metropolitan-oriented development strategies advance when lagging economic performance leads provincial leaders to fixate on boosting regional competitiveness, and when provincial governments have the political strength to impose their policy priorities over the objections of other\u00a0actors.\nRethinking the politics of spatial policy in an era of booming growth,\u00a0China\u2019s Urban Champions\u00a0highlights the key role of provincial units in determining the nation\u2019s metropolitan and regional development\u00a0trajectory.\nKyle A. Jaros is Associate Professor in the Political Economy of China at the University of Oxford and a Visiting Fellow at the University of Notre Dame's Liu Institute for Asia and Asian Studies (2019-2020).

But it often takes specialized skills and new ways of seeing to find the scientific work done by women. Sometimes women were given code names when research was published, a 17th-century strategy to protect their modesty. Sometimes tedious lab work was celebrated as \u201cheroic\u201d when done by men and dismissed as \u201cdrudgery\u201d when done by women. Or scientific organizations might divvy up the labor of science, assigning some tasks to women and other tasks to men, and then not talk about the women\u2019s roles\u2014as in the story Hidden Figures.

The 3-D printing process builds a three-dimensional object from a computer-aided design model by adding material, such as liquid resin or powder grains being fused together, layer by layer. This process is also known as additive manufacturing. In the early 1990s, 3-D printing techniques were considered suitable only for the production of functional or aesthetic prototypes. Fast-forward 30 years, and the speed, precision, repeatability, and material range have increased to the point that 3-D printing processes are now used in commercial industrial production. One of the key advantages of 3-D printing is the ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries directly without need for a mold. Thus the technology also lends itself to mass customization, where items, such as running shoes, can be customized to an individual\u2019s needs. Turner will discuss advances in the basic understanding of mechanical design of materials and components made via additive manufacturing. Liu will detail some of the state-of-the-art developments in additive manufacturing for the industrial scale; he has spent the last few years developing polymeric materials specifically for this application.

Italian merchants in 17th century Amsterdam\" \n(see abstract below)\nIt'll take place in Cherpack at 5:15 on Thursday Oct. 24. We hope to see many of you at this event.\n***\nABSTRACT\nEver since Genoese galleys had made their appearance at Bruges in the last quarter of the 13th century, communities of Italian long distance traders had been residing in the Low Countries. In the 16th century, most of them lived in Antwerp, then the commercial metropolis of the Low Countries. However, by the end of that century political and religious turmoil and climatological and demographic transformations had radically altered the trade patterns between the two regions. In 1585, Dutch rebels closed off Antwerp\u2019s access to the sea. Moreover, large parts of Italy became dependent upon the import of grains from the North. Therefore, by the 1590s many Italian merchants had left Antwerp. Subsequently, some of them, mostly Protestant Lucchese bankers, established themselves in Amsterdam.\n\u00a0In the final phases of the Thirty Years war a second wave of Italian migrants joined them. These new migrants mostly stemmed from humbler backgrounds. Moreover, they originated from provincial towns and not from commercial hubs such as Venice or Florence. Silvio Tensini, from Crema in Lombardy and his son in law Francesco Feroni, from Empoli in Tuscany were examples in point. In this lecture, I shall highlight the career of the latter.\n\u00a0Originally, Feroni concentrated on the import of Baltic grains to Italy, for which he established a network that stretched from Archangel in Russia, over Hamburg and Amsterdam to ports along the Tyrrhenian coast, such as Genoa, Livorno or Civitavecchia. Subsequently, he diversified his business and he started to import Spanish wools to the Netherlands and to export Dutch books, scientific instruments and works of art to Italy. Finally, he engaged in the triangular trade across the Atlantic in slaves and sugar. Moreover, Feroni acted as an information broker and an officious representative of the Medici Grand Dukes in the Dutch Republic. Within two decades, he became one of Amsterdam\u2019s wealthiest merchants.\nIn contrast to the first wave of immigrants, Feroni and his peers remained staunch Catholics. Thanks to his Roman contacts, he became an influential figure in the local Catholic minority community and he advocated its interests with the Protestant urban magistrate. Although it seems that Feroni never learnt Dutch, he thus was relatively well integrated.\nFrom the 1660s onward, a third wave of Italian migration followed suit. In response to the aggressive policies of King Louis XIV, Florentine bankers and merchants gradually withdrew from Paris and settled in Amsterdam. They stimulated a new increase both in the maritime and in the overland trade between the Dutch Republic and various Italian states. However, from the 1670s until the early 18th century, the Dutch economy entered a phase of stagnation and by then Amsterdam attracted less foreign merchants. In the 18th century, most Italian immigrants to the Dutch Republic would be artisans instead of merchants.\nFrancesco Feroni\u2019s extra-ordinary career testifies from the dynamic character of the Italian trade during an age in which the economy of the peninsula stagnated. His activities fit into a broader pattern and therefore it is worthwhile to analyze them.", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_id": "", "location": "Cherpack Seminar Room - 543 Williams Hall", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "summary": "", "title": "Hans Cools (Brueghel Visiting Professor at Penn) on Italians in Early Modern Amsterdam (Cherpack)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2019/10/hans-cools-brueghel-visiting-professor-penn-italians-early-modern-amsterdam-cherpack", "date_dt": "24-10-2019", "event_index": 379},

We look forward to seeing many of you at this talk!\n\u00a0\n*****\nWhen Richard Wagner created a lowered orchestra pit at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in the 1870s he famously described the decision in terms of concealment; an attempt to hide the means of sound production. In view of the modifications made to numerous opera houses in the decades that followed to create similar orchestra pits, scholars have tended to assume that the Festspielhaus was both the stimulus and model for such spaces. If this tends to flatten out important variations in architectural design between theaters, it also narrates the introduction of orchestra pits from the perspective of audience members alone. While lowered orchestral platforms might have functioned as so-called \u201cmystical chasms\u201d from which sound floated upwards towards awed spectators, these also had a crucial role in the creation of enclosed, protected spaces for musicians.\nThe 1907 construction of the so-called \u201cgolfo mistico\u201d at the preeminent Teatro alla Scala in Milan, under the supervision of Arturo Toscanini, was to a considerable extent an experiment in the creation of a more professional atmosphere than performance at audience level allowed. However much the term golfo mistico betrays a Romantic conception of the space, it was not, I argue, coincidental that the pit was constructed in the same moment that trade unions for musicians were establishing themselves. Meanwhile, musicians were also becoming familiar with other sorts of enclosures calibrated to control acoustics and eliminate distractions, in the form of the earliest sound studios. Placing La Scala\u2019s golfo mistico in the context of these dual developments in the Italian music industry at the time, I reveal the extent of the orchestra pit\u2019s entanglements in a musical landscape which increasingly placed musicians at one remove from their audiences; in tandem, I offer a new framework in which to make sense of the new (and enduring) fashion for this architectural innovation.", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_id": "", "location": "Music Building, Lerner Center 101", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "Prof. Laura Protano-Biggs", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "summary": "", "title": "Laura Protano-Biggs on the Teatro alla Scala in Milan (Music Building)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2019/11/laura-protano-biggs-teatro-alla-scala-milan-music-building", "date_dt": "19-11-2019", "event_index": 381},

The rigorous Scholastic style of thirteenth-century treatises began to be replaced with more cryptic styles, most notably by the use of vivid metaphorical language, often of a theological nature, that gradually transformed a practical art into a seemingly sanctified form of knowledge. One figure in this transformation is the radical Franciscan from the Auvergne John of Rupescissa--part-time alchemist and full-time prophet. He saw alchemy as a means to restore the Church following the imminent arrival and subsequent defeat of the Antichrist. This talk examines John's alchemical and religious ideas, reveals his surprising level of practical expertise and observational prowess (despite being imprisoned most of his life), explains his metaphors with the help of modern laboratory replications, and, using newly-discovered manuscript materials, explores how he thought the Church should deploy powerful scientific knowledge.", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_id": "", "location": "", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "summary": "", "title": "Lawrence Principe on Medieval Alchemy (Van Pelt, Class of 55, 2nd floor)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2020/02/lawrence-principe-medieval-alchemy-van-pelt-class-55-2nd-floor", "date_dt": "13-02-2020", "event_index": 383},

In 1760, six slaves submitted a confession and plea for mercy to the magistrate of Wuding Prefecture, Yunnan, the immediate superior of their dead master, Nuo Jiayou, a N\u00e9 (or Yi) native chieftain. The slaves had been caught, terrifyingly, between two factions struggling over who would succeed their master as the sole owner of all the lands and peoples within his extensive domain. Their plaint, which named the slaves as its collective author, was written in Chinese, a language they could neither speak nor write. This paper traces their footsteps as they followed their master\u2019s widow to the prefectural capital and found a translator and a cut-rate litigation master to fashion their plaint. I show how the slaves\u2019 own form of spatial literacy, developed through service in their master\u2019s house and participation in his rituals, may have helped them read and navigate the unfamiliar city. Thinking through the specificities of how slaves became writers and readers also helps better delineate the shape of slavery in Ne\u0301 places, which became the designated \u201cslave societies\u201d of Chinese social science despite ubiquitous slavery in every region and economic sector of the Empire. I argue that the native chieftain system itself became a system of bondage in Qing society, confining Ne\u0301 and other \u2018non-Chinese\u2019 to mountain enclaves while extracting their wealth and using their lives in military actions.\nErik Mueggler is Katherine Verdery Collegiate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Law enforcement representatives instead push family members to settle problems on their own. Given such a context, this presentation explores how law and legal norms impact relationships between parents and children after divorce. All dynamics of post-divorce kinship begin from the legal fact that there is no joint custody in Japan. Throughout the postwar, rates of custody being granted to mothers have steadily increased, and currently stand at eighty percent. Moreover sole legal custody is coupled with a cultural belief that a \u201cclean break\u201d can benefit children because it is psychologically less damaging to have no contact with one parent than shuttle between two households. However there is a growing movement, organized mostly by non-custodial fathers, to \u201creform\u201d Japanese family law and popularize a joint custody option. This presentation focuses on both people who experienced a \u201cclean break\u201d divorce and those who are increasingly calling that disconnection into question. I argue that although there are no requirements for shared custody, a substantial minority of families sustain de facto joint custody. Demonstrating contested, shifting ideals of familial bonds, these attempts to share custody highlight desires to redress the disconnection divorce produces and to create connected families, even when they bring legal risks.\nAllison Alexy\u00a0is an assistant professor in the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures and Department of Women\u2019s Studies at the University of Michigan.

In Japan, PM Abe is a leading promoter of the robotization of the labor force, including child- and elder-care, and has argued that robots will save the Japanese economy and liberate (married) women.

The first expansion of humans \u2013 Homo erectus- began 2.4 \u2013 1.8 million ago. The second expansion, this time of Homo sapiens sapiens, reached China between 85,000 and 80,000 BP. The expansion of speakers of Austronesian languages, returned to Africa, reaching Madagascar in the early centuries of the present era. The diffusion of domesticated plants, like bananas, from New Guinea to South Asia and Africa and dated to the mid-fourth millennium in Uganda and mid-first millennium BCE in southern Cameroon, provide additional evidence of interactions between Africa and Asia. Africa and Asia have long been in regular contact, through land and seas. \nMy paper will explore different facets of these Africa-Asia connections using glimpses gleaned from our ongoing archaeological research on the Island of Manda in Kenya, where we have unearthed excellent archaeological remains of the existence of trade between Africa and China. As to whether this interaction was direct, the jury is still out. Archaeologists presently accept the notion that the period between 700 and 1500 CE was the Era of Asian dominance.\u00a0 This was a time when the economic, social, and political order was vested in Buddhist and Islamist states, kingdoms, and empires. Interactions were dominated by regions that were connected by the Silk Road commercial complex.\nEastern and Southeastern Africa, which for millennia had pursued its own peculiar ways of making a living, was \u2018recruited\u2019 into this global network and became a regular partner.

Ch\u2019\u014fn, driven by the vicissitudes of the times, did not remain confined as a mere servant of the Yi Royal Household but was an influential figure in Chos\u014fn politics and diplomacy. She further played a crucial role in modernizing Korean Buddhism during the pre-colonial and colonial era\u2014equal in significance to the Korean Buddhist monastics with whom she worked. Despite her remarkable contributions toward modernizing the tradition, she is absent in the scholarship of Korean Buddhism. In this talk, I will draw on the known bits and pieces of information on Ch\u2019\u014fn to make a case that she played a seminal role in the incipient stage of modern Korean Buddhism. Ch\u2019\u014fn drew on a wide network of relationships both inside and outside the court to help establish the first modern institution of Korean Buddhism, build the first modern temple in central Seoul, and open the first modern Buddhist clinic in Korea. This article seeks to restore Ch\u2019\u014fn\u2019s centrality as a Buddhist modernizer, thereby ultimately bringing balance to a largely monastic-centered and nationalist history and lengthening the lineage of lay female leadership in the transformation of Korean Buddhism in the beginning of the twentieth century.\n", "endtime": "01:00 PM", "event_id": "", "location": "", "owner": "Center for East Asian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "Korean Studies Colloquium \"Restoring Buddhism to Seoul: Court Lady Ch\u2019\u014fn\u2019s Influence in Modernizing Korean Buddhism\"", "url": "https://ceas.sas.upenn.edu/events/korean-studies-colloquium-restoring-buddhism-seoul-court-lady-ch%E2%80%99%C5%8Fn%E2%80%99s-influence-modernizing", "date_dt": "05-12-2019", "event_index": 417},

They grew especially alarmed at the growing power the government was giving to psychiatrists to oversee the psychological wellbeing of Americans. Using the state\u2019s police powers, they feared, liberals would soon declare anti-communists and other conservatives mentally ill and banish them to mental institutions. Two events in the 1950s brought these anxieties to a fever pitch: the involuntary confinement of Vermont anti-communist activist Lucille Miller to a federal psychiatric hospital and federal legislation to fund the construction of a mental hospital in the Alaska territory.\n  In their campaigns to free Miller and stop the construction of what they believed would be an Alaskan gulag, these activists turned to the law. They argued that the Constitution safeguarded a vision of liberty as the absence of unwanted government intrusions into an individual\u2019s life. While these ultraconservative activists were dismissed as crackpots, many of their critics also felt a sense of diminished autonomy in the postwar world. In subsequent decades, they too would grow wary of government paternalism and embrace, for various reasons, a more libertarian understanding of rights. This idea of rights would eclipse an alternative vision of them as a tool for pursuing collective, egalitarian ends. To our growing body of explanations about how communitarian possibilities for civil rights and civil liberties were \u201clost\u201d or \u201ctamed\u201d in the middle of the twentieth century, we might add anxieties about the fragility of the individual mind, which the cultural life of the Cold War drove to unprecedented levels.", "endtime": "1:20 PM", "event_id": "60767", "location": "Faculty Lounge", "owner": "Law School", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "summary": "", "title": "Legal History Workshop: Daniel LaChance, Emory University", "url": "https://www.law.upenn.edu/newsevents/calendar.php#event_id/60767/view/event", "date_dt": "10-10-2019", "event_index": 428},

    {"date": "November 5, 2018", "description": "Professor Hirota\u2019s current book project, \u201cThe Business of the Nation: Foreign Contract Labor and the Rise of American Immigration Control,\u201d examines the transnational business of importing Asian, Canadian, European, and Mexican contract laborers to the United States and the evolution of federal alien contract labor law designed to restrict this form of immigration over the course of the long nineteenth century. Since the early nineteenth century, Americans opposed the immigration of poor foreign workers who would degrade the dignity of labor and lower American wage standards. The opposition to immigrant labor became especially strong in the case of contract workers. In 1885, American workers\u2019 antipathy to \u201calien contract labor\u201d resulted in the passage of the federal Foran Act to ban the landing of foreign contract workers and deport those already in the United States back to their countries of origin. This project examines how hostility toward contract labor migration influenced American immigration law and how the alien contract labor law in turn affected immigrant workers.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  The paper traces the intellectual and legal genealogy of alien contract labor law by surveying the antebellum roots of opposition to imported labor in the United States. While labor radicalism in the late nineteenth century played a crucial role in the introduction of the Foran Act, the federal law was built upon earlier discourses on servile labor and the economic impact on Americans of immigration of certain kinds. In particular, the paper identifies the following four issues in antebellum America as the ideological and legal origins of the alien contract labor law: 1) Free Soilism, 2) \u201cpauper labor\u201d discourse, 3) assisted emigration, and 4) coolieism. The analysis in this paper is not intended to provide new evidence or revise historiography on these topics. Instead, the paper aims to demonstrate how the antebellum debates over the four issues collectively, if not exclusively, laid the foundations for the federal alien contract labor law, placing it in the broader framework of immigration politics beyond the labor conflict in the late nineteenth century.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Hidetaka Hirota is a non-tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Institute for Advanced Study at Waseda University in Japan.

    {"date": "November 27, 2017", "description": "Between 1967 and 1979, the United States\u2019 divorce rate doubled. The rapidly rising divorce rate created a widespread crisis among women who had relied on their husbands for economic support and access to social insurance benefits such as Social Security and health insurance. In reponse, a now-forgotten strand of the 1970s feminist movement, which I call \u201cthe feminist divorce reform movement,\u201d emerged and organized itself around securing women\u2019s place in the United States\u2019 marriage-based insurance system. This paper, part of a larger project on this movement, examines divorce\u2019s decreasing political salience as more and more women entered the permanent workforce. In the 1970s, one-third of married American women were in the paid labor force. By 1985 that number had shot up. Even women with young children were now as likely to be found in the workforce as at home: around 50 percent of mothers with children under three and roughly 70 percent of mothers with children over six were in the labor force. In response, feminists who had once focused on shoring up the marriage-based insurance system turned their efforts toward securing women\u2019s place in the employment-based insurance system. In this paper I consider how legislative battles over the Family and Medical Leave Act, universal child care, and welfare reform fit into a longer history of feminist activism dedicated to creating a social insurance system that protected women from the economic vulnerabilities created by their carework obligations.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Suzanne Kahn received her Ph.D. in American History from Columbia University in 2015.

More specifically, the paper highlights the possible impact of the period of papal interdict (c. 1208 \u2013 1214), imposed by Pope Innocent III in response to King John\u2019s intransigence over the appointment of a new archbishop of Canterbury, during this transitional period in criminal procedure. It argues that the interdict, with its suspension of liturgies, might have forced experimentation with alternative means of reaching verdicts in felony cases. The paper also suggests that juries might have been involved in the issuance of ordeal verdicts in the late ordeal period in England, in which case the shift from trial by ordeal to trial by jury may be less a moment of rupture than a transition from one form of trial using juries to another, albeit a trial form more starkly desacralized after 1215. It is the author\u2019s hope that the paper will serve as a starting point for further research, not a decisive answer to the questions it raises, including whether England\u2019s rapid adoption of final jury verdicts may owe something to the tussle between King John and a particularly imperial and imperious pope.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Elizabeth Papp Kamali is an Assistant Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, where she teaches Criminal Law, English Legal History, Medieval English Law, and a seminar on Mind and Criminal Responsibility.\u00a0 She is a faculty member of Harvard\u2019s Standing Committee on Medieval Studies.\u00a0 Her research focuses on the medieval English common law and the history of criminal law, with a particular interest in the early criminal trial jury.\u00a0 Her current projects include studies of the role of criminal intent in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century English felony cases, medieval understandings of anger\u2019s operation in felony adjudication, conflict between urban customary law and the English common law in the early fourteenth century, and the influence of Roman law on the early development of the common law.\u00a0 Recent publications include \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Daughter of Hell Fire: Anger\u2019s Role in Medieval English Felony Cases\u201d (Law and History Review, 2017) and \u201cLaw and Equity in a Medieval English Manor Court\u201d (in Texts and Contexts in Legal History: Essays in Honor of Charles Donahue, 2016).", "endtime": "1:15 PM", "event_id": "55474", "location": "Faculty Lounge", "owner": "Law School", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "summary": "Workshop open to faculty and invited guests", "title": "Legal History Consortium Workshop: Elizabeth Kamali", "url": "https://www.law.upenn.edu/newsevents/calendar.php#event_id/55474/view/event", "date_dt": "11-10-2017", "event_index": 440},

Citizens of the frontline states between Russia and the European Union have long been familiar with this type of hybrid war. In his talk, Mitchell Orenstein contends that these \"lands in between\" hold powerful lessons for Western countries. Increasingly, the political pathologies of these small states in Europe are Western problems, too.\nIf you have any questions about the event, please e-mail Amber Grier at events@sas.upenn.edu.\u00a0\n\nSince 2005, expert faculty from the University of Pennsylvania have shed a light on their research at the\u00a0Penn Lightbulb Cafe.

Her humorous and fiercely nuanced portraits of voice, ethnicity, black culture, and diasporic spaces span both her fiction and her essays on painting, art, philosophy, and literary traditions ranging from E.M. Forster to Zora Neale Hurston.\u00a0 Received to widespread acclaim, Zadie Smith's first novel, White Teeth (2000), is a vibrant portrait of contemporary multicultural London, told through the story of three ethnically diverse families. The book won a number of awards and prizes, including the Guardian First Book Award, Whitbread First Novel Award, Commonwealth Writers Prize (Overall Winner, Best First Book), and two BT Ethnic and Multicultural Media Awards (Best Book/Novel and Best Female Media Newcomer). It was also shortlisted for the Mail on Sunday/John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, the Orange Prize for Fiction, and the Author\u2019s Club First Novel Award. White Teeth has been translated into over twenty languages and was adapted for Channel 4 television for broadcast in autumn 2002. Her tenure as Writer in Residence at the Institute of Contemporary Arts resulted in the publication of an anthology of erotic stories entitled Piece of Flesh (2001). More recently, she has written the introduction for The Burned Children of America (2003), a collection of eighteen short stories by a new generation of young American writers.Zadie Smith\u2019s second novel, The Autograph Man (2002), is a story of loss, obsession and the nature of celebrity. It won the 2003 Jewish Quarterly Literary Prize for Fiction. In 2003 and 2013 Granta magazine named her as one of 20 Best of Young British Novelists.

The vast journey of blue moves from Hebrew ritual uses of snail pigments to the chemistry and economics of blue jean dyes.\nAmerican chemist Roald Hoffmann is widely known for using quantum mechanics to help reveal the mechanisms of chemical reactions. He was born Roald Safran in 1937 in a small Polish town that is now part of the Ukraine. Hoffmann's father was a civil engineer familiar with the local infrastructure, which made him of value to the Nazis. For a while the family was allowed to remain in its own home, but was later relocated to a labor camp, where many of the Nazi guards could be bribed. After being paid off, the guards allowed 5-year-old Roald, his mother, two aunts, and an uncle to escape in early 1943. A Ukrainian couple hid them in the attic and storeroom of a nearby schoolhouse where the husband taught. Hoffmann's father remained behind in the camp, where he was tortured and killed by the Nazis in June 1943 for his involvement in a plot to arm camp prisoners.After the war ended, Hoffmann and his mother relocated to New York, where he later won a Westinghouse science scholarship to Columbia University, earning his BA there. He took his doctorate in chemistry from Harvard and in 1965 began teaching chemistry at Cornell, where he is now Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters Emeritus. Since 2002, Hoffmann has hosted a monthly cabaret called \"Entertaining Science\" at Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9 in Greenwich Village.In 1963 Hoffmann introduced the extended H\u00fcckel method, a molecular orbital theory that allows calculation of the electronic structure of molecules. In 1965, in collaboration with Nobel laureate Robert Burns Woodward, he introduced the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a method for exploring the electronic structure of transition states and intermediates in organic reactions. Hoffmann and Japanese chemist Kenichi Fukui shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1981 for their theories, developed independently, concerning the course of chemical reactions (Woodward had died two years earlier and thus was ineligible).Hoffmann is also a published poet, playwright, and essayist. His poems appear in several collections: The Metamict State (1987), Gaps and Verges (1990), Memory Effects (1999), and Soliton (2002). In addition, he is a philosopher of science who has made significant contributions to our conceptual, historical, and normative understanding of chemistry. Many of his philosophical essays have been collected in Roald Hoffman on the Philosophy, Art, and Science of Chemistry by Jeffrey Kovac and Michael Weisberg, eds. (2012).", "endtime": "6:30pm", "event_id": "", "location": "Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "The Allure of Indigo", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/allure-indigo", "date_dt": "22-10-2014", "event_index": 486},

Through film, photography and performance, the artists in this exhibition explore the contours of belonging across different contexts - from the invention of nationalist social rituals to the homecoming of veterans, from the trope of the \"haunted\" house to that of the family portrait. By bringing together the work of an international group of artists approaching home as a volatile concept, this exhibition examines how fantasies of belonging involve complex psychic and affective responses to specific material and historical conditions informed by race, gender, sexuality and class.\"Itinerant Belongings\" grounds this inquiry by revisiting critical debates that bridged activism and art in the 1980s and 1990s. Responding to the presence of the homeless, the displaced, and the disenfranchised in American cities, two of the artists in the exhibition, William Pope.L and Krzysztof Wodiczko, produced projects in this critical moment that questioned the very notion of what it meant for a space to be \"public.\" This exhibition aims to reanimate this dialogue and extend it to a contemporary global landscape marked by mass displacement, armed conflict, and debates around borders and immigration.Work by Yael Bartana, Jamie Diamond, Andrew Moore, William Pope.L, Paul Salveson, Jessica Vaughn, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, and Krzysztof Wodiczko will be on display at Slought and the Addams Gallery at PennDesign, and viewers are encouraged to take an itinerant path from one exhibition site to another.\nMore information", "endtime": "", "event_id": "", "location": "Slought, 4017 Walnut Street, PhiladelphiaAddams Fine Arts Hall, 200 S. 36th Street, Philadelphia", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "", "summary": "", "title": "Itinerant Belongings", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/itinerant-belongings", "date_dt": "01-11-2014", "event_index": 487},

How do their patterns provide protective camouflage in tropical rain forests? How is nanotechnology using the waterproofing properties of butterfly colors to fabricate energy-efficient materials for buildings? In this panel discussion, Penn researchers discuss how their scientific and technological work imitates nature.\nUsing holographic lithography, Shu Yang and her Penn research team recently developed a material that mimics the iridescent and water-resistant qualities of butterfly wings. Applying this innovation, they developed a superhydrophobic coating that can be sprayed onto any surface. The solution contains nanoscopic particles that add a nearly invisible layer of roughness to a surface. Among other things, this highly water resistant coating is now being used on solar panels to keep them drier, cleaner and more efficient.\nIn 2004, Shu Yang was named one of the World's Top 100 Innovators Under 35 by MIT Technology Review. In 2006, she received the prestigious Faculty Early Career Development Award from the National Science Foundation. And in 2011, she was selected by the National Academy of Engineering to present at the Japan-America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium.

Value with respect to color can mean the relative lightness or darkness of a hue, but can also mean aesthetic merit, political importance, moral acceptability, or material worth. The question of color's values is also fundamentally a question of sensory perception, constructed at the level of the individual synapse as well as the cultural collective. We want to consider the descriptive language of color\u2014how we evoke color with and/or through value-laden words or actions, how we assign qualities or quantities to different colors, how color is experienced through taste or touch as well as sight.Four distinguished scholars - Richard Doyle, Torkwase Dyson, Nicole Fleetwood, and Mohan Matthen - will explore the values of color from a variety of perspectives. How and why do we classify and assign values (moral, economic, social, epistemic) to particular colors, even 'people of color,' or material gradations, from light to dark? How does color function in a modern economy? What is its role in making subjectivity legible through its performance? How does color function as nonverbal communication that is affectively felt? To what degree is color a 'natural' or physical property and in what ways is it a rhetorical or cultural construction? And, how do institutions assign value to color?\u00a0\nSCHEDULE10:00-10:15am | WelcomeElizabeth Della Zazzera, Graduate Humanities Forum ChairNese Devenot, GHF Mellon Fellow\n10:15am-12:30pm | Panel DiscussionModerators: Jeannie Kenmotsu and Ting Fung Ho, GHF Mellon FellowsCommentators: Louise Daoust and Alan Niles, GHF Mellon Fellows\nRichard Doyle\nBy the Way, Which One's Pink?: On the Minimal Conditions for a Transmission of Philip K.

Called synesthesia, this human perceptual condition in which information between the senses is blended has long fascinated scientists and laypeople alike. Award-winning neuroscientist and New York Times bestselling author David Eagleman presents new findings from his research into the behavioral, neurological, and genetic characteristics of synesthetes.\nThere are an infinite number of boring things to do in science. But we live these short life spans. Why not do the thing that's the coolest thing in the world to do? \u2014David Eagleman, The New Yorker\n\nDavid Eagleman is best known for his work on time perception, synesthesia, and neurolaw. He directs the Laboratory for Perception and Action at the Baylor College of Medicine, whose goal is to understand how the brain constructs perception, how different brains do so differently, and how this matters for society. He also founded and directs Baylor's Initiative on Neuroscience and Law, which studies how new discoveries in neuroscience should navigate the way we make laws, punish criminals, and develop rehabilitation. And, he founded and is chief scientific officer for BrainCheck, a company that uses interactive testing on portable tablets to measure brain function, which schools are using to rapidly measure concussions at the sidelines.\nIn 2011, Eagleman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and that same year won the Eric Hoffer Book Award Montaigne Medal for his book Wednesday is Indigo Blue: Discovering the Brain of Synesthesia, coauthored with Richard Cytowic. In 2012 he was named Science Educator of the Year by the Society for Neuroscience, and was featured as one of the year's Brightest Idea Guys by Italy's Style Magazine. In 2014, he received the John J. McGovern Award for Excellence in Biomedical Education from the American Medical Writers' Association.\nOne of his latest books, Livewired: How the Brain Rewrites its Own Circuitry, is due in spring 2015 (Doubleday Canada). Also in Fall 2015, Eagleman will host the new PBS science series, \"The Brain with Dr. David Eagleman.\"\nFrom the Eagleman Laboratory website, in his own words:\"Public understanding of science is a passion of mine, and to that end I have written for the New York Times, Discover Magazine, Atlantic, The Week, Slate, Wired, New Scientist, and others. I speak often on National Public Radio and BBC to discuss what's new and important in science. I have founded a prize in mathematics and physics.\"I am fortunate to be a Guggenheim Fellow. Within the scientific community, I serve as an editor for Journal of Vision, PLoS One, and Seminars in Brain and Consciousness. I also serve on the board of directors for several organizations, including The Long Now Foundation.\"My book of fiction, Sum, was lucky enough to become an international bestseller. It has been translated into 27 languages and was named a Best Book of the Year by Barnes and Noble, New Scientist, and the Chicago Tribune. British musician Brian Eno and I performed a musical reading of Sum at the Sydney Opera House, and German composer Max Richter translated Sum into a full opera at the Royal Opera House in London.\"My neuroscience book Incognito became a New York Times bestseller, and was named a Book of the Year by Amazon, Goodreads, Houston Chronicle, and Boston Globe. No one is writing an opera for that one yet, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.\"", "endtime": "6:30pm", "event_id": "", "location": "Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "The Kaledioscopic Brain of Synesthesia", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/kaledioscopic-brain-synesthesia", "date_dt": "25-02-2015", "event_index": 500},

    {"date": "October 22, 2019 - 5:15pm", "description": "The Department of Music\u2019s main Colloquium Series showcases new research by leading scholars across the fields of musicology, ethnomusicology, music theory, and composition both in the United States and internationally.\u00a0 Music Colloquia take place on Tuesdays at 5:15 in Lerner Center, Room 102.\u00a0 The Lerner Center is located at\u00a0 201 S. 34th Street, Philadelphia Pa, 19104-6313.\u00a0See here\u00a0for the full calendar of the 2019-2020 Colloquia Series.\n\nDavid Grubbs, Professor of Music, Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center, CUNY\nTwo Experiments in Music Writing\n\nFor this presentation, Grubbs will present excerpts from both of these new books together with a discussion of the nexus of music and literature, including reflections on his ongoing collaboration with the poet Susan Howe.\u00a0Following his investigation into experimental music and recorded sound in\u202fRecords Ruin the Landscape: John Cage, the Sixties, and Sound Recording (Duke University Press, 2014), David Grubbs has produced two book-length experiments in music writing. Now that the audience is assembled\u202f(Duke, 2018) is a prose poem that describes a fictional musical performance during which an unnamed musician improvises the construction of a series of invented instruments before an audience that is alternately contemplative, participatory, disputatious, and asleep. Both a work of literature and a study of music,\u202fNow that the audience is assembled\u202fexplores the categories of improvised music, solo performance, text scores, instrument building, aesthetic deskilling and reskilling, and the odd fate of the composer in experimental music. Grubbs\u2019s forthcoming The Voice in the Headphones (Duke, 2020) centers on the culture of the recording studio, presenting in intricate, prismatic detail one marathon day in a recording studio over the course of which an unnamed musician struggles to complete a film soundtrack. The Voice in the Headphones arrives at a moment in which the commercial recording studio shades into oblivion and is replaced by digital work environments; it draws upon Grubbs\u2019s own history of several decades as a recording artist, and its location could be described as every studio in which he has set foot. The experience of working in the recording studio is in large part the experience of the language that surrounds and infuses the world of the studio\u2014and that language is the material of this poem.\n\nAbout David Grubbs\n\nDavid Grubbs is Professor of Music at Brooklyn College and The Graduate Center, CUNY.\u00a0 At Brooklyn College he also teaches in the MFA programs in Performance and Interactive Media Arts (PIMA) and Creative Writing.\u00a0 He is the author of Now that the audience is assembled and Records Ruin the Landscape: John Cage, the Sixties, and Sound Recording\u00a0(both Duke University Press)and, with Anthony McCall, Simultaneous Soloists (Pioneer Works Press).\u00a0 In the spring of 2020, Duke University Press will publish The Voice in the Headphones, Grubbs\u2019s second experiment in music writing in the form of a book-length poem.\n\nGrubbs has released fourteen solo albums and appeared on more than 190 releases; his most recent solo recording is Creep Mission (Blue Chopsticks, 2017). In 2000, his The Spectrum Between\u00a0(Drag City) was named \u201cAlbum of the Year\u201d in the London Sunday Times.\u00a0 He is known for his ongoing cross-disciplinary collaborations with poet Susan Howe and visual artists Anthony McCall and Angela Bulloch, and his work has been presented at, among other venues, the Solomon R.

As we think about the possibilities for digital campuses, corporations and communities in the future, it is important to keep in mind the limits of technology in solving social problems. Despite the optimistic promises of digital evangelists, it has become clear that most large-scale software systems exacerbate existing social inequality.\u00a0\nIn this talk, author and professor Meredith Broussard looks at the inner workings and outer limits of technology, and explains why we should never assume that computers always get things right.

Losing Pravda argues that a crisis of journalism is unlike any other: it fundamentally erodes the value of truth-seeking and truth-telling in a society. For this lecture, Roudakova will focus on the Soviet period, specifically on how relations of confidence and trust were established between newspaper readers and Soviet journalists. This is especially relevant today in light of the crisis of trust in mainstream media across the world, and in light of various attempts to revive participatory, impact- and solutions-driven journalism in Western newsrooms.\nNatalia Roudakova is a cultural anthropologist (Ph.D., Stanford University, 2007) working in the fields of political communication, journalism, and media studies, with an interest in moral philosophy and political and cultural theory. Roudakova has a broad international research and teaching profile, having worked as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Communication, University of California in San Diego; as Visiting Professor at Erasmus University in Rotterdam (Netherlands); and as Researcher in the Department of Communication at S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University, Sweden.\nIn 2013-2014, Roudakova was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Alto, California, where she completed her award-winning book,\u00a0Losing Pravda: Ethics and the Press in Post-Truth Russia\u00a0(Cambridge University Press, 2017).\u00a0Losing Pravda\u00a0examines the spectacular professional unraveling of journalism in Russia during the 1990s and 2000s and its societal ramifications.

Alexander L. Fattal shows how the market has become one of the principal grounds on which counterinsurgency warfare is waged and postconflict futures are imagined in Colombia. This layered case study illuminates a larger phenomenon: the convergence of marketing and militarism in the twenty-first century. Taking a global view of information warfare,\u00a0Guerrilla Marketing\u00a0combines archival research and\u00a0extensive fieldwork not just with the Colombian Ministry of Defense and former rebel communities, but also with political exiles in Sweden and peace negotiators in Havana. Throughout, Fattal deftly intertwines insights into the modern surveillance state, peace and conflict studies, and humanitarian interventions, on one hand, with critical engagements with marketing, consumer culture, and late capitalism on the other. The result is a powerful analysis of the intersection of conflict and consumerism in a world where governance is increasingly structured by brand ideology and wars sold as humanitarian interventions.\n\u00a0\nFull of rich, unforgettable ethnographic stories,\u00a0Guerrilla Marketing\u00a0is a stunning and troubling analysis of the mediation of global conflict.\n\nNew Yorker\n\n\"A sobering book on how armies burnish their brands. . . a detailed, eye-opening investigation.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nReVista\n\n\"Guerrilla Marketing\u00a0is a fascinating book that illustrates how the government\u2019s turn to marketing blurred the boundaries between war and peace by penetrating deep into the emotional space of insurgents and their families. It is a well-written account that intersperses analytic chapters with the author\u2019s riveting interviews with FARC insurgents, which offer a view into how the rebels understand what has happened to themand sidesteps PAHD propaganda. The book should be read by anyone trying to understand contemporary Colombian society.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nJon Lee Anderson, author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life\n\n\u201cGuerrilla Marketing\u00a0is a fascinating examination of how commercial-style branding has been deployed by both rebels and the state in Colombia's civil war.

This dystopian narrative has come to dominate political agendas across the globe. To save democracy \u2014 a number of voices argue \u2014 radical measures are needed. In this talk, Johan Farkas critically examines post-truth discourses, honing in on both the contemporary threats posed by disguised propaganda on social media and the risks of advancing undemocratic solutions to solve them.\nThe first part of the talk dives into the rise and proliferation of disguised propaganda on social media, drawing on empirical cases such as the Internet Research Agency in Russia and fake Muslim Facebook pages in Denmark. While disguised propaganda is not a new phenomenon in itself, the technological architecture of digital platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, enables new forms of manipulation, tactically exploiting interfaces, algorithmic proliferation, and content moderation policies. This poses novel challenges for democracy.\nDisguised propaganda in digital media have caused scholars, journalists, and politicians to talk about a post-truth crisis in dire need of fixing. Indeed, for many, truth must be restored at all costs, as democracy is founded on evidence-based decision-making. The second part of the talk critically engages with these post-truth discourses and the solutions they contain. Engaging with critical political philosophy, Farkas highlights how these \"democratic imaginaries\" neglect how democracy has never been about truth, evidence and rationality alone. It is equally about the voice of the democratic people. By neglecting this cornerstone of the democratic tradition, post-truth discourses reproduce and strengthen a risky vision of democracy \u2014 one in which consensus and rationality dominate over civic voices and popular dispute. By doing so, contemporary post-truth discourses \u2014 and the solutions they contain \u2014 might end up deepening existing democratic problems.\nThe talk is based on Farkas\u2019 new book, Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy: Mapping the Politics of Falsehood, written with Jannick Schou and published by Routledge.\nAbout the Speaker\nJohan Farkas is a Ph.D. Fellow in Media and Communication Studies at Malm\u00f6 University in Sweden. His research engages with the intersection of digital media platforms, disinformation, politics, journalism, and democracy. Farkas has published on these topics in international journals such as New Media & Society, Social Media + Society, and Critical Discourse Studies. In September 2019, his debut book, Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy: Mapping the Politics of Falsehood (with Jannick Schou) was published by Routledge. The book presents a detailed analysis of contemporary discourses of fake news and post-truth, offering both a trenchant critique and call for more inclusive forms of democracy.

    {"date": "25 Oct 2019 - 12:00pm to 1:00pm", "description": "About the Talk\nWhy do people believe and share misinformation, including entirely fabricated news headlines (\u201cfake news\u201d) and biased or misleading coverage of actual events (\"hyper-partisan\" content)? The dominant narrative in the media and among academics is that we believe misinformation because we want to \u2014 that is, we engage in motivated reasoning, using our cognitive capacities to convince ourselves of the truth of statements that align with our political ideology rather than to undercover the truth. In a series of survey experiments using American participants, David Rand and colleagues challenged this account. They consistently found that subjects who perform better on the Cognitive Reflection Test (a measure of the tendency to engage in analytic thinking) are better able to identify false or biased headlines \u2014 even for headlines that align with individuals\u2019 political ideology (for details, see here and here). They also found that when examining actual Twitter behavior, more reflective individuals share information from higher quality news sources. These findings suggest that susceptibility to misinformation is driven more by mental laziness and lack of reasoning than it is by partisan bias hijacking the reasoning process. They then build on this observation to examine interventions to fight the spread of misinformation. In one, they show that laypeople are much less biased in their evaluation of the trustworthiness of news outlets than one might imagine, and give fake news and hyperpartisan outlets low trust ratings regardless of their political slant. Thus, using crowdsourced ratings of outlet quality to inform social media ranking algorithms is a promising approach (for details, see here). Second, the researchers demonstrate the power of making the concept of accuracy top-of-mind, thereby increasing the likelihood that people think about the accuracy of headlines before they decide whether to share them. Rand's results suggest that reasoning is not held hostage by partisan bias, but that instead participants do have the ability to tell fake or inaccurate from real \u2014 if they bother to pay attention. The findings also suggest simple, cost-effective behavioral interventions to fight the spread of misinformation.\nAbout the Speaker\nDavid G. Rand is the Erwin H. Schell Professor and an Associate Professor of Management Science and Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT Sloan, and the Director of the Human Cooperation Laboratory and the Applied Cooperation Team.\nBridging the fields of behavioral economics and psychology, Rand\u2019s research combines mathematical/computational models with human behavioral experiments and online/field studies to understand human behavior. His work uses a cognitive science perspective grounded in the tension between more intuitive versus deliberative modes of decision-making, and explores topics such as cooperation/prosociality, punishment/condemnation, perceived accuracy of false or misleading news stories, political preferences, and the dynamics of social media platform behavior. His work has been published in peer-reviewed journals such Nature, Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, the American Economic Review, Psychological Science, and Management Science. He has received widespread attention from print, radio, TV and social media outlets, and has also written popular press articles for outlets including the New York Times, Wired, New Scientist, and the APS Observer. He was named to Wired magazine\u2019s The Smart List 2012: \u201c50 people who will change the world,\u201d chosen as a 2012 Pop!Tech Science Fellow, received the 2015 Arthur Greer Memorial Prize for Outstanding Scholarly Research, and was selected as fact-checking researcher of the year in 2017 by the Poytner Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network. Papers he has coauthored have been awarded Best Paper of the Year in Experimental Economics, Social Cognition, and Political Methodology.\nRand received his B.A. in Computational Biology from Cornell University in 2004 and his Ph.D. in Systems Biology from Harvard University in 2009, was a post-doctoral researcher in Harvard University\u2019s Department of Psychology from 2009 to 2013, and was an Assistant and then Associate Professor of Psychology, Economics, and Management at Yale University prior to joining the faculty at MIT.", "endtime": "1:00pm", "event_id": "", "location": "Annenberg School for Communication, Room 500", "owner": "Annenberg School of Communication", "speaker": " David G.

If infrastructure conditions how information, people, and things circulate, then what might the practices of concealment tell us about the political stakes of circulation, and about the nature of our infrastructural surround? What kinds of visual forms emerge in global media events in which concealment is crucial part, sometimes even the condition of possibility for targetable people and equipment to stay on air. This colloquium examines these contradictions in the context of Lebanon, where infrastructural disrepair and breakdown parallel political impasses and fragmentation. It takes the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year as its case study. Based on fieldwork and visual analysis, El-Hibri examines how concealment structures phenomena ranging from live satellite news broadcasts, drone-cam footage, signal jamming and hacking, and online guerilla video from the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year.

In his book,\u00a0The Palestinian Idea, Greg Burris argues that it is precisely through film and media that hope can occasionally emerge amidst hopelessness, emancipation amidst oppression, freedom amidst apartheid. The author employs the work of Edward W. Said, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, and Cedric J. Robinson in order to locate Palestinian utopia in the heart of the Zionist present. He analyzes the films of prominent directors Annemarie Jacir (Salt of This Sea,\u00a0When I Saw You) and Hany Abu-Assad (Paradise Now) to investigate the emergence and formation of Palestinian identity. Looking at Mais Darwazah\u2019s documentary\u00a0My Love Awaits Me by the Sea, Burris considers the counterhistories that make up the Palestinian experience\u2014stories and memories that have otherwise been obscured or denied. He also examines Palestinian (in)visibility in the global media landscape, and how issues of Black-Palestinian transnational solidarity are illustrated through social media, staged news spectacles, and hip hop music.\u00a0\n\"A deeply felt, brilliantly conceived, meticulously crafted book,\u00a0The Palestinian Idea\u00a0breaks new ground in how we understand vision, space, and identity.

How is certain novel information about the world nevertheless made meaningful in their everyday lives? While a growing number of studies have focused on the role of multi-platform mobile technology in young people\u2019s daily experiences, few studies have aimed to reconceptualize news from this perspective, paying particular attention to the phenomenology of news perception in the digital age. Such a reconceptualization is all the more important since the basic dimensions of phenomenology \u2013 namely, time, space and cultural relevance \u2013 coincide with the basic dimensions of news as a cultural form.

Through a consideration of the television set\u2019s intertwining with devices ranging from VCRs to set-top boxes and optical-fiber cables, Chirumamilla exposes new veins of analysis through which we might understand both the inter-media history within which television in South India is embedded and the kinds of mediated futures that television\u2019s material transformations portend.\n\u00a0\nFollowing an overview of her larger project, which utilizes both ethnographic research and close textual analysis of newspapers, enthusiast magazines, and policy documents, Chirumamilla will turn her focus to the objects of the television set, the videotape, and the VCR. How does looking at these objects in concert with each other change our imagining of the historical trajectory of television in South India? She will argue that the television set\u2019s entanglement with videotapes and the VCR is illustrative of the contentious, close relationship between the commercial cinema industry and television\u2019s growing presence within the lives of Indian media consumers; an entanglement that has so far gone understudied and might offer us new ways to think about how we theorize the pasts and futures of media technologies.\n\u00a0\n\nAbout the Speaker\nPadma Chirumamilla\u00a0is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication.

    {"date": "October 11 2019", "description": "This talk is concerned with the use of nonlinear homogenization to study the effective response of composites. We look to illustrate the effect that constitutive assumptions have on the methods by which such estimates can be obtained, as well as on the actual effective, or homogenized, response of the material. Although helpful in ensuring existence in a variational setting, convexity is often inconsistent with certain physical requirements (e.g. objectivity). Such is the case of hyperelasticity, the subject of the first part of the talk. The lack of convexity of the stored-energy functions of such hyperelastic systems has long been known to lead to the development of instabilities. When such instabilities do not result in material failure, we look to study the post-bifurcation behavior of the system. We present a framework for doing so, and compute the post-bifurcation response of a laminated hyperelastic composite explicitly under general three-dimensional loading conditions. In the second part of the talk, we will consider the class of magneto-elastic composites, which consist of hyperelastic materials that are also magnetically susceptible. Unlike in the case of hyperelasticity, there lacks a complete mathematical framework for obtaining the effective response of such materials, and researchers have only begun to investigate the potential for instabilities in these materials. We therefore look to generalize the same methodology used successfully in the purely mechanical context to study the post-bifurcation behavior of magneto-elastic composites. This in part requires a rigorous generalization of the theoretical aspects that underlie the method. With this, we calculate the post-bifurcation response of a magneto-elastic material under general plane-strain loading conditions with a magnetic field applied in the plane of deformation.", "endtime": "1:00 PM", "event_id": "", "location": "Towne 309,  220 S. 33rd Street", "owner": "Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM)", "speaker": "Joshua Furer\nPh.D. Candidate, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics\nAdvisor: Pedro Ponte Casta\u00f1ada", "starttime": "11:00 AM", "summary": "", "title": "MEAM Doctoral Dissertation Defense: \u201cProblems in Nonlinear Homogenization: Bounds, Estimates, Macroscopic Instabilities, and Post-Bifurcation Response\u201d", "url": "https://events.seas.upenn.edu/event/meam-doctoral-dissertation-defense-problems-in-nonlinear-homogenization-bounds-estimates-macroscopic-instabilities-and-post-bifurcation-response/", "date_dt": "11-10-2019", "event_index": 702},

These limitations can be overcome using drop-based microfluidics in which picoliter-sized, water-in-oil emulsions serve as independent microreactors, allowing for the compartmentalization of microbes and high-throughput assaying at the single cell level. Here, drop-based microfluidics is used to interrogate the physiological heterogeneity of P. aeruginosa cells in a microbial population using a technique we name DropSOAC (Drop Stabilization On A Chip). The DropSOAC method stabilizes the position and volume of monodisperse water-in-oil drops with diameters <20 mm within a monolayer array on a microfluidic chip for 24 h. The stability of drops is maintained by soaking the device in a reservoir containing both water and oil in thermodynamic equilibrium. This ensures that phase equilibrium of the drop emulsion fluids within the porous PDMS material structure is maintained during drop incubation and imaging. Continuing this work, we aim to study the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance now observed in common bacterial strains to find effective treatments for persistent bacterial infections. This will be performed using a microfluidic chip that is capable of encapsulating in parallel, 96 barcoded assay samples in drops using fluorescent particles. Using a custom-built microscope that can read fluorescence from drops at rates of thousands per second, we demonstrate sorting for a particular barcode combination from our droplet library. The results presented here show the potential of drop-based microfluidics for high-throughput assaying of heterogeneous populations of microbes at the single cell level.", "endtime": "4:00 PM", "event_id": "", "location": "Wu and Chen Auditorium (Room 101), Levine Hall,  3330 Walnut Street", "owner": "Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CBE)", "speaker": "Connie Chang, PhD\nAssistant Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Montana State University\nConnie B.

Almost half a century after these researchers applied powerful mathematical techniques of topology to condensed matter systems, a new rapidly developing area is taking shape, now in the field of photonics. While very different in many respects from their condensed matter counterparts, topological phases of light share some of their unique properties that make topological photonics particularly suitable for practical applications. Just as the inventors of photonic crystals (often referred to as the \u201csemiconductors of light\u201d) borrowed crucial ideas, such as propagation bands, bandgaps, and Brillouin zone, from condensed matter physics, so do the researchers in the field of topological photonics that attempts to emulate the key concepts from low-dimensional topological materials. Those include photonic topological insulators (PTIs), reflection-less edge states that propagate along the domain walls of the PTIs, and spin-polarized/valley-polarized transport.\nIn this talk, Dr. Shvets will provide an overview of the field, with special emphasis on the photonic emulation of the canonical quantum topological phases such as the Hall, spin-Hall, and valley-Hall phases. He will then describe how such heterogeneous PTIs can be integrated and used for developing novel devices such as compact circulators. Experimental results demonstrating reflection-less transport of topologically protected edge states will be presented. He will also discuss how the ideas from topological photonics can be used for complete reimagining of the architectures of photonic devices such as add/drop filters, delay lines, and logical gates based on the valley degree of freedom of photons (\u201cphotonic valleytronics\u201d).

This vision entails large networks with dynamic connectivity, ad hoc formation and heterogeneous nodes. Central to be able to integrate all our lives to this massive virtual domain is security and privacy of the information that flows through it. Current wireless systems have security of information as an add-on to current design, and rely on application layer protocols, which have worked well for the scale and the resources of the systems to date. Going forward however, with massive scale formation of networks of asymmetric resources, these protocols involving key exchanges and shared randomness for security may prove to be less than practical.\nSecuring information at the foundation of system design can alleviate these issues by replacing or strengthening the present cryptographic solutions. This foundational design approach brings us to information theoretic security for the all- connected world. In this talk, we will provide an overview of this approach that relies on local randomness and produces information theoretic security guarantees, e.g, for confidentiality and authentication, utilizing the properties of the transmission medium. We will review the insights that have emerged when information security is included as a design primitive and provide the state of the art directions towards realizing the potential of this approach.

    {"date": "October 22 2019", "description": "Structural biological materials, such as animal bones and shells, display remarkable mechanical properties despite being composed of quite simple and ordinary constituent materials. For example, the toughness of nacre, a structural biological material found in the shells of some mollusks, is orders of magnitude higher than that of its primary constituent\u2014the calcium based mineral aragonite. A number of structural biological materials that display toughness enhancement also possess a lamellar architecture consisting of alternating layers of ceramic and organic phases. It is believed that a structural biological material\u2019s intricate architecture\u2014the geometric arrangement of these phases\u2014is responsible for the observed property enhancements. Within the bio-mimetics community, there is currently great interest in reproducing these architectures in synthetic materials using micro-fabrication and 3D printing in order to achieve the property enhancements observed in structural biological materials.\nIn this talk I will present experimental and computational mechanics results that show that correctly identifying the connection between a structural biological material\u2019s architecture and any property enhancements can be a very delicate process. Specifically, I will present experiments that characterize the toughness properties of the skeletal elements of the marine sponge Euplectella aspergillum, called spicules. I will show that despite possessing a lamellar architecture that is very similar to that seen in nacre, the spicules do not display a significant toughness enhancement. Through mechanics modeling, I argue that the spicule\u2019s lamellar architecture is connected to their ability to bend more without failing, i.e., to their strength, rather than their toughness. These results serve as a reminder that any efforts aimed at reproducing a structural biological material\u2019s architecture and property enhancements in synthetic materials should be prefaced by a careful investigation of the structural biological material itself.\nReferences\n[1] Monn, Michael A., James C.

    {"date": "November 5 2019", "description": "Modern image sensors consist of systems of cascaded and bulky spherical optics for imaging with minimal aberrations. While these systems provide high-quality images, the improved functionality comes at the cost of increased size and weight. One route to reduce a system\u2019s complexity is via computational imaging, in which much of the aberration correction and functionality of the optical hardware is shifted to post-processing in the software realm. Alternatively, a designer could miniaturize the optics by replacing them with diffractive optical elements, which mimic the functionality of refractive systems in a more compact form factor. Metasurfaces are an extreme example of such diffractive elements, in which quasiperiodic arrays of resonant subwavelength optical antennas impart spatially-varying changes on a wavefront. While separately both computational imaging and metasurfaces are promising avenues toward simplifying optical systems, a synergistic combination of these fields can further enhance system performance and facilitate advanced capabilities.

This \u201cbiomimetic\u201d approach results in an increasingly successful representation of the environmental milieu of tissue development, regeneration and disease. Living human tissues are now being engineered from various types of human stem cells, and tailored to the patient and the condition being treated. A reverse paradigm is now emerging with the development of the \u201corgans on a chip\u201d platforms for modeling of integrated human physiology, using micro-tissues that are derived from human iPS cells and functionally connected by vascular perfusion. In all cases, the critical questions relate to our ability to recapitulate the cell niches, using bioengineering tools. To illustrate the state of the art in the field and reflect on the current challenges and opportunities, this talk will discuss: (i) anatomically correct bone regeneration, (ii) bioengineering of the lung, (iii) heart repair by a cell-free therapy, and (iv) the use of \u201corgans on a chip\u201d for patient-specific studies of human physiology, injury, healing and disease.\nFunding: NIH, NSF, New York State, Mikati Foundation, Schwartz Foundation\nCatered reception to follow.", "endtime": "4:30 PM", "event_id": "", "location": "Glandt Forum, Singh Center for Nanotechnology,  3205 Walnut Street", "owner": "School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS)", "speaker": "Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic, Ph.D.\nUniversity Professor, The Mikati Foundation Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Medical Sciences, Columbia University in the City of New York\nGordana Vunjak-Novakovic and her research team have been able to grow bone grafts that will match a patient\u2019s original jaw bone for facial reconstruction surgery to repair injuries, disease, or birth defects. This spectacular advancement in bone tissue engineering provides all the advantages of the body\u2019s original jaw bone. The team used real bone as a scaffold to grow the new TMJ graft. Taking the knee joints of calves, they stripped them of all their living cells and carved them into cubic centimeter-size parts of a human jaw joint.\nUsing mesenchymal stem cells, which can differentiate into many cell types, to seed the scaffolding, they fed them with streams of nutrients, growth factors, and oxygen in a bioreactor.

    {"date": "November 8 2019", "description": "Abstract: Blood clot formation involves the coupled processes of platelet aggregation and coagulation, which are triggered when there is break in a blood vessel. Platelet aggregation is largely a physical process while coagulation is biochemical, consisting of a large network of reactions that culminate in the generation of the enzyme thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin, which polymerizes into fibers to form a stabilizing gel matrix in and around growing platelet aggregates. Thrombin also (re)binds directly to fibrin but this interaction, and its purpose, is not fully understood. Thrombin-fibrin binding is often described as two independent, single-step binding events, one high-affinity and one low-affinity, each through a different exosite on thrombin. However, kinetic schemes describing these single-step binding events with reported kinetic rate constants cannot explain experimentally-observed residency times of fibrin-bound thrombin. In this work, we study a bivalent, sequential-step binding scheme as an alternative to the high-affinity event, and in addition to the low-affinity one. We developed mathematical models for the single- and sequential-step schemes consisting of reaction-diffusion equations to compare to each other and to previously published experimental data. We then used Bayesian inference, in the form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo, to learn model parameter distributions from the experimental data. For the model to best fit the data, we needed an additional assumption that thrombin was irreversibly sequestered; we hypothesized that this could be due to thrombin becoming physically trapped within fibrin fibers as they formed. We also discuss how our model can be used to further probe scenarios dealing with thrombin allostery.", "endtime": "3:00 PM", "event_id": "", "location": "Towne 337", "owner": "Penn Institute for Computational Science (PICS)", "speaker": "Karin Leiderman\nAssociate Professor, Director of Graduate Studies, Department of Applied Math & Statistics, Colorado School of Mines\nKarin Leiderman is an Associate Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Colorado School of Mines.

Structural differences between crystal polymorphs can affect desired properties, such as bioavailability of active pharmaceutical formulations, lethality of pesticides, or electrical conductivity of organic semiconductors. Crystallization conditions can influence polymorph selection, making an experimentally driven hunt for polymorphs difficult. Such efforts are further complicated when polymorphs initially obtained under a particular experimental protocol \u201cdisappear\u201d in favor of another polymorph in subsequent repetitions of the experiment. Consequently, theory and computational can potentially play a vital role in mapping the landscape of crystal polymorphism.

    {"date": "November 26 2019", "description": "Recent developments in nanostructured materials have demonstrated myriad desirable properties ranging from optical and mechanical metamaterials to biomanipulative surfaces. To bring these properties from the lab to the commercial space will require innovative nanomanufacturing strategies focused on scalable and cost-effective techniques. My lab, the Hybrid Micro/Nanomanufacturing Laboratory, applies the manipulation of fundamental driving forces to this challenge through combinations of top-down and bottom-up techniques for new hybrid lithographic strategies. In this seminar, I will highlight one such strategy: self-limiting electrospray deposition (SLED) of thin film microcoatings. Electrospray deposition is a well-established technique for the creation of thin films from the spray of highly charged droplets loaded with the materials to be deposited. In SLED, specific manipulation of the electrostatic repulsion, hydrodynamic forces, and evaporation kinetics can be employed to conformally cover 3D architectures with microcoatings. The generated coatings are hierarchical, possessing either nanoshell or nanowire microstructure. Having demonstrated the mechanism of the self-limiting effect, we have developed the ability to employ materials that would be otherwise incompatible with self-limiting. In this way we have incorporated a wide variety of functional systems, including: (1) biocompatible, (2) plasmonic, (3) elastomerically-toughened composite, (4) anti-corrosive epoxy or sol gel, and (5) electrically conductive coatings. We have also characterized the geometric limits of features that can be coated through this approach, showing that the 3D capabilities increase with decreasing feature size to the micron-scale. This property, combined with the hierarchical structure of the coatings, shifts the burden of micro/nanoscale resolution from a costly or slow technique to a more scalable method, thereby removing barriers for integration into advanced manufacturing techniques such as roll-to-roll or additive manufacturing.", "endtime": "12:00 PM", "event_id": "", "location": "Wu and Chen Auditorium (Room 101), Levine Hall,  3330 Walnut Street", "owner": "Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM)", "speaker": "Jonathan Singer\nAssistant Professor, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Rutgers University\nJonathan Singer obtained his PhD (2013) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and MSc and BS (2008) from the University of Pennsylvania, all in Materials Science and Engineering.
