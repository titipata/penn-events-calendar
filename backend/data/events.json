In this presentation, I argue that much of what we think we \u201cknow\u201d about racial profiling is wrong. Popular definitions of the term \u201cracial profiling\u201d are much too narrow or too vague, and, in this way, they are wrong. I contend prevailing thought on the causes of racial profiling as residing within individuals is deeply flawed and leads to interventions that will be ineffective such as implicit bias training. I demonstrate that racial profiling is not primarily a problem of biased cognitions; instead, racial profiling is caused by remediable structural factors that are beyond the control of individual officers patrolling American streets. These structural factors motivate police officers to take racially biased actions and facilitate racial profiling by providing legally defensible shields to conceal biased actions. The recognition of the true causes of racial profiling combined with technological innovations in policing lead to real-world solutions that could end racial profiling.\u00a0", "endtime": "01:00 PM", "event_index": 64, "location": "395 McNeil Building\u00a0\n3718 Locust Walk\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Dapartment of Criminology", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "title": "Criminology Colloquium Series: Ojmarrh Mitchell", "url": "https://crim.sas.upenn.edu/events/criminology-colloquium-series-ojmarrh-mitchell"},

However, establishing a tight link between these allocation patterns and firm conduct has been difficult because there exist cost-based explanations that can generate these allocation patterns under competition. Focusing on the set of auctions in which the winning bid and the losing bids are very close, we use ideas similar to regression discontinuity design to distinguish between allocation patterns that simply reflect cost differences across firms and those that are indicative of collusion. We derive conditions under which our test has correct size under the null of competition. Applying our test to the sample of municipal auctions in Japan, we find evidence of collusion among the set of procurement auctions whose winning bid is relatively high.Keywords: Procurement, Collusion, Backlog, Incumbency, Regression Discontinuity, Regulation. * Corresponding author: kei@berkeley.edu. We thank Frank Wolak for helpful comments on an early draft. We also thank seminar audiences at Duke, Northwestern, and Berkeley-Paris Organizational Economics Workshop for helpful comments.\n1The ability of competition authorities to proactively detect and punish collusion is crucial for achieving the goal of promoting and maintaining competition. Not only do the possibility of detection and prosecution serve as strong deterrents against collusion, they also affect the incentives of firms in existing cartels to apply for leniency programs. Successful identification of cartels thus deters collusive activity and complements the effectiveness of leniency programs.In the absence of concrete leads, using screens to flag suspicious firm conduct can be useful for regulators as a first step in identifying collusion. While screens cannot substitute for direct evidence of collusion such as testimonies and records of communication, they can provide guidance on which markets or firms to focus investigation. A growing number of agencies are adopting screens that use algorithms to flag suspicious behavior using bidding data from public procurement auctions.1 In fact, there are a number of cases in which investigation was initiated on the basis of screens alone, and, ultimately, resulted in successful cartel prosecution.2 The results from screens can also be used in court to obtain warrants or authorization for a more intrusive investigation. They can be used in court for civil antitrust litigation and private litigation as well.\n3Screening of cartels can also be useful to those outside of antitrust authorities. For example, screening can help procurement offices counter suspected bidding rings by more aggressively soliciting new bidders or adopting auction mechanisms that are less susceptible to collusion. Screening may also be helpful for internal auditors and compliance officers of complicit firms to identify collusion and help contain potential exposure from it.In this paper, we propose a way to test for collusion using one of the most commonly 1 Competition authorities that use statistical analysis or algorithms to screen for collusion include those in Brazil, South Korea, Switzerland and United Kingdom.

During booms, employment in agriculture declines while labor productivity increases in agriculture more than in other sectors. We construct a unified theory of business cycles and structural change consistent with the stylized facts. The focal point of the theory is the simultaneous decline and modernization of agriculture.

We call such acquisitions \"killer acquisitions.\" We develop a parsimonious model illustrating this phenomenon. Using pharmaceutical industry data, we show that acquired drug projects are less likely to be developed when they overlap with the acquirer's existing product portfolio, especially when the acquirer's market power is large due to weak competition or distant patent expiration. Conservative estimates indicate about 6% of acquisitions in our sample are killer acquisitions. These acquisitions disproportionately occur just below thresholds for antitrust scrutiny.JEL Classification: O31, L41, G34, L65", "endtime": "5:00pm", "event_index": 107, "location": "PCPSE Room 100 \n          United States", "owner": "Department of Economics", "speaker": "Florian Ederer\n\n      Yale University", "starttime": "3:30pm", "title": "Killer Acquisitions *", "url": "https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/events/killer-acquisitions"},

The FLM generalizes Luce's model and naturally captures bounded rationality models while behaviorally distinguishing between what is focal and the magnitude of the bias due to focality. We show how to identify utilities, focal sets, and bias terms from choice frequencies and behaviorally found the FLM with two weakenings of independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA) which account for the decision maker's revealed focus. We introduce a new condition on focal sets, Conditionally Decreasing, which captures an increasing difficulty of focusing on multiple alternative and encompasses several models of limited consideration. We apply our model to experimental data, illustrate the importance of accounting for focus in demand estimation, and propose a simple method to identify focal sets.", "endtime": "5:30pm", "event_index": 108, "location": "PCPSE Room TBD \n          United States", "owner": "Department of Economics", "speaker": "Matthew Kovach\n\n      Virginia Tech", "starttime": "4:00pm", "title": "The Focal Luce Model *", "url": "https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/events/focal-luce-model"},

Using our model, we demonstrate how not taking into account the agent's preference for early (late) resolution of uncertainty would lead an analyst to underestimate (resp., overestimate) the agent's risk aversion.

Both of these strategies base their efficacy in enacting harm to bodies in response to acute emotional distress. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, for example, the goddess Demeter refuses to let the grain grow in protest for her daughter\u2019s kidnapping, which in turn creates a crisis of hunger in both mortal and immortal societies. In Euripides\u2019 Hippolytus, Phaedra avenges unrequited love for her stepson through an escalation of attacks on her own body, which ultimately leads to his demise. Phaedra responds to the shame she feels by committing suicide, and before that to the depression brought forth by unrequited love through starvation. In multiple versions of her myth, Medea\u2019s anger at her treatment by the men around her causes her to lash out, whether against Jason in Euripides\u2019 Medea through the murder of her children or against her father in Apollonius Rhodius\u2019 Argonautica through the dismemberment of her brother. In a real-world example from the Greek Magical Papyri, a woman named Artemisie commissions a lead curse tablet against the father of her daughter, appealing to the supernatural to punish him for not giving their child a proper burial (PGM XL). In these and other cases, women refuse to accept the decisions and roles meted out by the men who have legal authority over them.

Available information in this scenario commonly includes longitudinal measurements from the same subject. Since future information is unknown and may develop dynamically over time, such a predictive problem is challenging. We consider a predictive approach based on modeling the forward intensity function. The forward intensity function approach is appealing for being capable of intrinsically incorporating the future dynamics that affect the stochastic event occurrence. To handle the practical difficulty due to the missing data in the longitudinal measurements, and to accommodate observations at irregularly spaced time points, we propose a smoothed composite likelihood approach for estimating the forward intensity model. Our theoretical analysis establishes the validity of the predictive modeling approach and the smoothed composite likelihood method. Extensive simulations and real data analysis demonstrate the promising performance of the predictive approach.

A long-standing problem with such regression analyses is the lack of effective diagnostic tools for validating model assumptions. The difficulty arises from the fact that an ordinal variable has discrete values that are labeled with, but not, numerical values. The values merely represent ordered categories. In this paper, we propose a surrogate approach to defining residuals for an ordinal outcome Y. The idea is to define a continuous variable S as a \u201csurrogate\u201d of Y and then obtain residuals based on S. For the general class of cumulative link regression models, we study the residual\u2019s theoretical and graphical properties. We show that the residual has null properties similar to those of the common residuals for continuous outcomes. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the residual has power to detect misspecification with respect to 1) mean structures; 2) link functions; 3) heteroscedasticity; 4) proportionality; and 5) mixed populations. The proposed residual also enables us to develop numeric measures for goodness-of-fit using classical distance notions. Our results suggest that compared to a previously defined residual, our residual can reveal deeper insights into model diagnostics. We stress that this work focuses on residual analysis, rather than hypothesis testing. The latter has limited utility as it only provides a single p-value, whereas our residual can reveal what components of the model are mis specified and advise how to make improvements.\n\n\n  This is a joint work with Dungang Liu, University of Cincinnati Lindner College of Business.", "endtime": " 4:30pm", "event_index": 251, "location": "701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "3:30pm ", "title": "Biostatistics Seminar Series - Heping Zhang, PhD", "url": "http://events.med.upenn.edu/cceb/#!view/event/event_id/710452"},

She has contributed to the growing evidence base that seeks to prioritize behavior recommendations for management of CKD as well as assessing barriers to healthy behavior engagement. She has conducted studies that have identified high levels of substandard health behavior engagement among adults with CKD and phenotypes of behavior engagement that associate with clinical outcomes in this population.

The workshop will convene at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for the Study of Contemporary China (CSCC) on Saturday, October 26, 2019. CHAIR brings young IR scholars together to share their latest research related to China, build a professional network, and strengthen the academic community that focuses on China and IR topics. CHAIR is also the ideal venue for participants to present revised versions of papers from APSA\u2019s summer 2019 meeting or rough drafts of papers for ISA\u2019s spring 2020 convention. CSCC will reimburse participants up to $500 for accommodation and travel expenses. The bulk of our applications tends to come from the United States and Canada, but we are open to applicants from around the world (those traveling from beyond the US East Coast may be eligible for additional funding).\nWe are looking for approximately ten participants to present works that are part of their dissertations or that they intend to publish. Paper topics span the entire range of the IR sub-field, and abstracts will be chosen based on their level of development, fit with other submissions as part of a cohesive session, and representation of diverse perspectives, methodologies, and institutions. The day-long workshop will consist of four thematically-organized sessions, each comprised of 2-3 presenters and a discussant. Each presenter need only offer a\u00a0brief\u00a0overview of the paper (~5 minutes), to be followed by the discussant\u2019s short, detailed comments on all the papers (~15 minutes). The majority of each session will be devoted to discussion open to all the participants.\u00a0We expect all participants to have read the papers before the workshop, so that workshop discussions on the day can be as fruitful and productive as possible.\nCHAIR offers an opportunity to build a community of young IR scholars who study China, and there will be ample time for socializing throughout the day. In addition to inter-session breaks, a catered lunch will be provided and, at the workshop\u2019s conclusion, we will be pleased to host dinner at a local restaurant for further conversation in a more casual setting. CHAIR thus represents an excellent opportunity for academic enrichment and professional networking. To see past workshop participants and papers, please visit our\u00a0Facebook page.

Wary of these dangers, China\u2019s national leaders have tried to forestall top-heavy urbanization. However, urban and regional development policies at the subnational level have not always followed suit.\u00a0China\u2019s Urban Champions\u00a0explores the development paths of different provinces and asks why policymakers in many cases favor big cities in a way that reinforces spatial inequalities rather than reducing\u00a0them.\nKyle Jaros combines in-depth case studies of Hunan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Jiangsu provinces with quantitative analysis to shed light on the political drivers of uneven development. Drawing on numerous Chinese-language written sources, including government documents and media reports, as well as a wealth of field interviews with officials, policy experts, urban planners, academics, and businesspeople, Jaros shows how provincial development strategies are shaped by both the horizontal relations of competition among different provinces and the vertical relations among different tiers of government. Metropolitan-oriented development strategies advance when lagging economic performance leads provincial leaders to fixate on boosting regional competitiveness, and when provincial governments have the political strength to impose their policy priorities over the objections of other\u00a0actors.\nRethinking the politics of spatial policy in an era of booming growth,\u00a0China\u2019s Urban Champions\u00a0highlights the key role of provincial units in determining the nation\u2019s metropolitan and regional development\u00a0trajectory.\nKyle A.

The 3-D printing process builds a three-dimensional object from a computer-aided design model by adding material, such as liquid resin or powder grains being fused together, layer by layer. This process is also known as additive manufacturing. In the early 1990s, 3-D printing techniques were considered suitable only for the production of functional or aesthetic prototypes. Fast-forward 30 years, and the speed, precision, repeatability, and material range have increased to the point that 3-D printing processes are now used in commercial industrial production. One of the key advantages of 3-D printing is the ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries directly without need for a mold. Thus the technology also lends itself to mass customization, where items, such as running shoes, can be customized to an individual\u2019s needs. Turner will discuss advances in the basic understanding of mechanical design of materials and components made via additive manufacturing. Liu will detail some of the state-of-the-art developments in additive manufacturing for the industrial scale; he has spent the last few years developing polymeric materials specifically for this application.

Italian merchants in 17th century Amsterdam\" \n(see abstract below)\nIt'll take place in Cherpack at 5:15 on Thursday Oct. 24. We hope to see many of you at this event.\n***\nABSTRACT\nEver since Genoese galleys had made their appearance at Bruges in the last quarter of the 13th century, communities of Italian long distance traders had been residing in the Low Countries. In the 16th century, most of them lived in Antwerp, then the commercial metropolis of the Low Countries. However, by the end of that century political and religious turmoil and climatological and demographic transformations had radically altered the trade patterns between the two regions. In 1585, Dutch rebels closed off Antwerp\u2019s access to the sea. Moreover, large parts of Italy became dependent upon the import of grains from the North. Therefore, by the 1590s many Italian merchants had left Antwerp. Subsequently, some of them, mostly Protestant Lucchese bankers, established themselves in Amsterdam.\n\u00a0In the final phases of the Thirty Years war a second wave of Italian migrants joined them. These new migrants mostly stemmed from humbler backgrounds. Moreover, they originated from provincial towns and not from commercial hubs such as Venice or Florence. Silvio Tensini, from Crema in Lombardy and his son in law Francesco Feroni, from Empoli in Tuscany were examples in point. In this lecture, I shall highlight the career of the latter.\n\u00a0Originally, Feroni concentrated on the import of Baltic grains to Italy, for which he established a network that stretched from Archangel in Russia, over Hamburg and Amsterdam to ports along the Tyrrhenian coast, such as Genoa, Livorno or Civitavecchia. Subsequently, he diversified his business and he started to import Spanish wools to the Netherlands and to export Dutch books, scientific instruments and works of art to Italy. Finally, he engaged in the triangular trade across the Atlantic in slaves and sugar. Moreover, Feroni acted as an information broker and an officious representative of the Medici Grand Dukes in the Dutch Republic. Within two decades, he became one of Amsterdam\u2019s wealthiest merchants.\nIn contrast to the first wave of immigrants, Feroni and his peers remained staunch Catholics. Thanks to his Roman contacts, he became an influential figure in the local Catholic minority community and he advocated its interests with the Protestant urban magistrate. Although it seems that Feroni never learnt Dutch, he thus was relatively well integrated.\nFrom the 1660s onward, a third wave of Italian migration followed suit. In response to the aggressive policies of King Louis XIV, Florentine bankers and merchants gradually withdrew from Paris and settled in Amsterdam. They stimulated a new increase both in the maritime and in the overland trade between the Dutch Republic and various Italian states. However, from the 1670s until the early 18th century, the Dutch economy entered a phase of stagnation and by then Amsterdam attracted less foreign merchants. In the 18th century, most Italian immigrants to the Dutch Republic would be artisans instead of merchants.\nFrancesco Feroni\u2019s extra-ordinary career testifies from the dynamic character of the Italian trade during an age in which the economy of the peninsula stagnated. His activities fit into a broader pattern and therefore it is worthwhile to analyze them.", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_index": 363, "location": "Cherpack Seminar Room - 543 Williams Hall", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "title": "Hans Cools (Brueghel Visiting Professor at Penn) on Italians in Early Modern Amsterdam (Cherpack)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2019/10/hans-cools-brueghel-visiting-professor-penn-italians-early-modern-amsterdam-cherpack"},

We look forward to seeing many of you at this talk!\n\u00a0\n*****\nWhen Richard Wagner created a lowered orchestra pit at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in the 1870s he famously described the decision in terms of concealment; an attempt to hide the means of sound production. In view of the modifications made to numerous opera houses in the decades that followed to create similar orchestra pits, scholars have tended to assume that the Festspielhaus was both the stimulus and model for such spaces. If this tends to flatten out important variations in architectural design between theaters, it also narrates the introduction of orchestra pits from the perspective of audience members alone. While lowered orchestral platforms might have functioned as so-called \u201cmystical chasms\u201d from which sound floated upwards towards awed spectators, these also had a crucial role in the creation of enclosed, protected spaces for musicians.\nThe 1907 construction of the so-called \u201cgolfo mistico\u201d at the preeminent Teatro alla Scala in Milan, under the supervision of Arturo Toscanini, was to a considerable extent an experiment in the creation of a more professional atmosphere than performance at audience level allowed. However much the term golfo mistico betrays a Romantic conception of the space, it was not, I argue, coincidental that the pit was constructed in the same moment that trade unions for musicians were establishing themselves. Meanwhile, musicians were also becoming familiar with other sorts of enclosures calibrated to control acoustics and eliminate distractions, in the form of the earliest sound studios. Placing La Scala\u2019s golfo mistico in the context of these dual developments in the Italian music industry at the time, I reveal the extent of the orchestra pit\u2019s entanglements in a musical landscape which increasingly placed musicians at one remove from their audiences; in tandem, I offer a new framework in which to make sense of the new (and enduring) fashion for this architectural innovation.", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_index": 365, "location": "Music Building, Lerner Center 101", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "Prof. Laura Protano-Biggs", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "title": "Laura Protano-Biggs on the Teatro alla Scala in Milan (Music Building)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2019/11/laura-protano-biggs-teatro-alla-scala-milan-music-building"},

The rigorous Scholastic style of thirteenth-century treatises began to be replaced with more cryptic styles, most notably by the use of vivid metaphorical language, often of a theological nature, that gradually transformed a practical art into a seemingly sanctified form of knowledge. One figure in this transformation is the radical Franciscan from the Auvergne John of Rupescissa--part-time alchemist and full-time prophet. He saw alchemy as a means to restore the Church following the imminent arrival and subsequent defeat of the Antichrist. This talk examines John's alchemical and religious ideas, reveals his surprising level of practical expertise and observational prowess (despite being imprisoned most of his life), explains his metaphors with the help of modern laboratory replications, and, using newly-discovered manuscript materials, explores how he thought the Church should deploy powerful scientific knowledge.", "endtime": "7:00 pm", "event_index": 367, "location": "", "owner": "Italian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:15 pm", "title": "Lawrence Principe on Medieval Alchemy (Van Pelt, Class of 55, 2nd floor)", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/italians/event/2020/02/lawrence-principe-medieval-alchemy-van-pelt-class-55-2nd-floor"},

Law enforcement representatives instead push family members to settle problems on their own. Given such a context, this presentation explores how law and legal norms impact relationships between parents and children after divorce. All dynamics of post-divorce kinship begin from the legal fact that there is no joint custody in Japan. Throughout the postwar, rates of custody being granted to mothers have steadily increased, and currently stand at eighty percent. Moreover sole legal custody is coupled with a cultural belief that a \u201cclean break\u201d can benefit children because it is psychologically less damaging to have no contact with one parent than shuttle between two households. However there is a growing movement, organized mostly by non-custodial fathers, to \u201creform\u201d Japanese family law and popularize a joint custody option. This presentation focuses on both people who experienced a \u201cclean break\u201d divorce and those who are increasingly calling that disconnection into question. I argue that although there are no requirements for shared custody, a substantial minority of families sustain de facto joint custody. Demonstrating contested, shifting ideals of familial bonds, these attempts to share custody highlight desires to redress the disconnection divorce produces and to create connected families, even when they bring legal risks.\nAllison Alexy\u00a0is an assistant professor in the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures and Department of Women\u2019s Studies at the University of Michigan.

In humans, these behaviors are both socially and historically shaped, but are also contingent upon many situational influences, including individual choices. I will explore the sex/gender dynamics informing the design and embodiment of artificial intelligence (AI) and robots, especially humanoids. In Japan, PM Abe is a leading promoter of the robotization of the labor force, including child- and elder-care, and has argued that robots will save the Japanese economy and liberate (married) women.

The first expansion of humans \u2013 Homo erectus- began 2.4 \u2013 1.8 million ago. The second expansion, this time of Homo sapiens sapiens, reached China between 85,000 and 80,000 BP. The expansion of speakers of Austronesian languages, returned to Africa, reaching Madagascar in the early centuries of the present era. The diffusion of domesticated plants, like bananas, from New Guinea to South Asia and Africa and dated to the mid-fourth millennium in Uganda and mid-first millennium BCE in southern Cameroon, provide additional evidence of interactions between Africa and Asia. Africa and Asia have long been in regular contact, through land and seas. \nHis paper will explore different facets of these Africa-Asia connections using glimpses gleaned from our ongoing archaeological research on the Island of Manda in Kenya, where we have unearthed excellent archaeological remains of the existence of trade between Africa and China. As to whether this interaction was direct, the jury is still out. Archaeologists presently accept the notion that the period between 700 and 1500 CE was the Era of Asian dominance.\u00a0 This was a time when the economic, social, and political order was vested in Buddhist and Islamist states, kingdoms, and empires. Interactions were dominated by regions that were connected by the Silk Road commercial complex.\nEastern and Southeastern Africa, which for millennia had pursued its own peculiar ways of making a living, was \u2018recruited\u2019 into this global network and became a regular partner. Its highly desirable resources included ambergris, aromatic products, iron bloom, gold, ivory, leopard skins, and rhinoceros\u2019 horns among others.\u00a0 Our paper address eastern Africa\u2019s participation in these transformational global networks using archaeological data. We specifically focus on two sets of data from the Manda site: Chinese porcelain and Identities of the participants in this trade, through a discussion on the human remains recovered at Manda.\n", "endtime": "05:30 PM", "event_index": 394, "location": "", "owner": "Center for East Asian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "4:30pm", "title": "CEAS Humanities Series \"Ancient trade networks between China and Africa\"", "url": "https://ceas.sas.upenn.edu/events/ceas-humanities-series-ancient-trade-networks-between-china-and-africa"},

The community of such scholars is relatively small, and dispersed across numerous institutions, and there are few opportunities for these individuals to convene and share work. This Series is an effort to connect these scholars and to enrich their shared intellectual life. Second, the Series aims to be especially valuable to junior faculty and advanced graduate students, by providing them with feedback from, and opportunities to interact with, more established members of the normative business ethics community. To that end, we hope to have one junior author and one senior author at each session.\nWorkshop Format\nThe workshop will meet roughly once each month over the academic year. Any academic or practitioner with an interest in normative business ethics is invited to attend the sessions. Attendees are expected to read the papers in advance and to come with feedback for the paper authors. To maximize the opportunity for paper improvement, authors will not present their papers; we will instead spend our time together on questions and comments for the author.\nSessions will be held on Fridays, beginning at 1:00 pm unless otherwise indicated. We will discuss two to three papers at each session. Attendees are expected to read the papers in advance and to come prepared to offer feedback.\nThe sessions will be held on the following dates:\nOctober 4, 2019\nOctober 25, 2019\nNovember 22, 2019\nFebruary 7, 2020\nApril 3, 2020\nMay 1, 2020\n+ Google Calendar+ iCal Export", "endtime": "4:30 PM", "event_index": 407, "location": "", "owner": "Zicklincenter Center for Business Ethics", "speaker": "", "starttime": "1:00 PM", "title": "Normative Business Ethics Workshop Series of the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research", "url": "https://zicklincenter.wharton.upenn.edu/event/normative-business-ethics-workshop-series-of-the-carol-and-lawrence-zicklin-center-for-business-ethics-research-6/"},

They grew especially alarmed at the growing power the government was giving to psychiatrists to oversee the psychological wellbeing of Americans. Using the state\u2019s police powers, they feared, liberals would soon declare anti-communists and other conservatives mentally ill and banish them to mental institutions. Two events in the 1950s brought these anxieties to a fever pitch: the involuntary confinement of Vermont anti-communist activist Lucille Miller to a federal psychiatric hospital and federal legislation to fund the construction of a mental hospital in the Alaska territory.\n  In their campaigns to free Miller and stop the construction of what they believed would be an Alaskan gulag, these activists turned to the law. They argued that the Constitution safeguarded a vision of liberty as the absence of unwanted government intrusions into an individual\u2019s life. While these ultraconservative activists were dismissed as crackpots, many of their critics also felt a sense of diminished autonomy in the postwar world. In subsequent decades, they too would grow wary of government paternalism and embrace, for various reasons, a more libertarian understanding of rights. This idea of rights would eclipse an alternative vision of them as a tool for pursuing collective, egalitarian ends. To our growing body of explanations about how communitarian possibilities for civil rights and civil liberties were \u201clost\u201d or \u201ctamed\u201d in the middle of the twentieth century, we might add anxieties about the fragility of the individual mind, which the cultural life of the Cold War drove to unprecedented levels.", "endtime": "1:20 PM", "event_index": 409, "location": "Faculty Lounge", "owner": "Law School", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "title": "Legal History Workshop: Daniel LaChance, Emory University", "url": "https://www.law.upenn.edu/newsevents/calendar.php#event_id/60767/view/event"},

Since the early nineteenth century, Americans opposed the immigration of poor foreign workers who would degrade the dignity of labor and lower American wage standards. The opposition to immigrant labor became especially strong in the case of contract workers. In 1885, American workers\u2019 antipathy to \u201calien contract labor\u201d resulted in the passage of the federal Foran Act to ban the landing of foreign contract workers and deport those already in the United States back to their countries of origin. This project examines how hostility toward contract labor migration influenced American immigration law and how the alien contract labor law in turn affected immigrant workers.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  The paper traces the intellectual and legal genealogy of alien contract labor law by surveying the antebellum roots of opposition to imported labor in the United States. While labor radicalism in the late nineteenth century played a crucial role in the introduction of the Foran Act, the federal law was built upon earlier discourses on servile labor and the economic impact on Americans of immigration of certain kinds. In particular, the paper identifies the following four issues in antebellum America as the ideological and legal origins of the alien contract labor law: 1) Free Soilism, 2) \u201cpauper labor\u201d discourse, 3) assisted emigration, and 4) coolieism. The analysis in this paper is not intended to provide new evidence or revise historiography on these topics. Instead, the paper aims to demonstrate how the antebellum debates over the four issues collectively, if not exclusively, laid the foundations for the federal alien contract labor law, placing it in the broader framework of immigration politics beyond the labor conflict in the late nineteenth century.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Hidetaka Hirota is a non-tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Institute for Advanced Study at Waseda University in Japan.

The vast journey of blue moves from Hebrew ritual uses of snail pigments to the chemistry and economics of blue jean dyes.\nAmerican chemist Roald Hoffmann is widely known for using quantum mechanics to help reveal the mechanisms of chemical reactions. He was born Roald Safran in 1937 in a small Polish town that is now part of the Ukraine. Hoffmann's father was a civil engineer familiar with the local infrastructure, which made him of value to the Nazis. For a while the family was allowed to remain in its own home, but was later relocated to a labor camp, where many of the Nazi guards could be bribed. After being paid off, the guards allowed 5-year-old Roald, his mother, two aunts, and an uncle to escape in early 1943. A Ukrainian couple hid them in the attic and storeroom of a nearby schoolhouse where the husband taught. Hoffmann's father remained behind in the camp, where he was tortured and killed by the Nazis in June 1943 for his involvement in a plot to arm camp prisoners.After the war ended, Hoffmann and his mother relocated to New York, where he later won a Westinghouse science scholarship to Columbia University, earning his BA there. He took his doctorate in chemistry from Harvard and in 1965 began teaching chemistry at Cornell, where he is now Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters Emeritus. Since 2002, Hoffmann has hosted a monthly cabaret called \"Entertaining Science\" at Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9 in Greenwich Village.In 1963 Hoffmann introduced the extended H\u00fcckel method, a molecular orbital theory that allows calculation of the electronic structure of molecules. In 1965, in collaboration with Nobel laureate Robert Burns Woodward, he introduced the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a method for exploring the electronic structure of transition states and intermediates in organic reactions. Hoffmann and Japanese chemist Kenichi Fukui shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1981 for their theories, developed independently, concerning the course of chemical reactions (Woodward had died two years earlier and thus was ineligible).Hoffmann is also a published poet, playwright, and essayist. His poems appear in several collections: The Metamict State (1987), Gaps and Verges (1990), Memory Effects (1999), and Soliton (2002). In addition, he is a philosopher of science who has made significant contributions to our conceptual, historical, and normative understanding of chemistry. Many of his philosophical essays have been collected in Roald Hoffman on the Philosophy, Art, and Science of Chemistry by Jeffrey Kovac and Michael Weisberg, eds. (2012).", "endtime": "6:30pm", "event_index": 463, "location": "Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:00pm", "title": "The Allure of Indigo", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/allure-indigo"},

Through film, photography and performance, the artists in this exhibition explore the contours of belonging across different contexts - from the invention of nationalist social rituals to the homecoming of veterans, from the trope of the \"haunted\" house to that of the family portrait. By bringing together the work of an international group of artists approaching home as a volatile concept, this exhibition examines how fantasies of belonging involve complex psychic and affective responses to specific material and historical conditions informed by race, gender, sexuality and class.\"Itinerant Belongings\" grounds this inquiry by revisiting critical debates that bridged activism and art in the 1980s and 1990s. Responding to the presence of the homeless, the displaced, and the disenfranchised in American cities, two of the artists in the exhibition, William Pope.L and Krzysztof Wodiczko, produced projects in this critical moment that questioned the very notion of what it meant for a space to be \"public.\" This exhibition aims to reanimate this dialogue and extend it to a contemporary global landscape marked by mass displacement, armed conflict, and debates around borders and immigration.Work by Yael Bartana, Jamie Diamond, Andrew Moore, William Pope.L, Paul Salveson, Jessica Vaughn, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, and Krzysztof Wodiczko will be on display at Slought and the Addams Gallery at PennDesign, and viewers are encouraged to take an itinerant path from one exhibition site to another.\nMore information", "endtime": "", "event_index": 464, "location": "Slought, 4017 Walnut Street, PhiladelphiaAddams Fine Arts Hall, 200 S. 36th Street, Philadelphia", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "", "title": "Itinerant Belongings", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/itinerant-belongings"},

How do their patterns provide protective camouflage in tropical rain forests? How is nanotechnology using the waterproofing properties of butterfly colors to fabricate energy-efficient materials for buildings? In this panel discussion, Penn researchers discuss how their scientific and technological work imitates nature.\nUsing holographic lithography, Shu Yang and her Penn research team recently developed a material that mimics the iridescent and water-resistant qualities of butterfly wings. Applying this innovation, they developed a superhydrophobic coating that can be sprayed onto any surface. The solution contains nanoscopic particles that add a nearly invisible layer of roughness to a surface. Among other things, this highly water resistant coating is now being used on solar panels to keep them drier, cleaner and more efficient.\nIn 2004, Shu Yang was named one of the World's Top 100 Innovators Under 35 by MIT Technology Review. In 2006, she received the prestigious Faculty Early Career Development Award from the National Science Foundation. And in 2011, she was selected by the National Academy of Engineering to present at the Japan-America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium.

The question of color's values is also fundamentally a question of sensory perception, constructed at the level of the individual synapse as well as the cultural collective. We want to consider the descriptive language of color\u2014how we evoke color with and/or through value-laden words or actions, how we assign qualities or quantities to different colors, how color is experienced through taste or touch as well as sight.Four distinguished scholars - Richard Doyle, Torkwase Dyson, Nicole Fleetwood, and Mohan Matthen - will explore the values of color from a variety of perspectives. How and why do we classify and assign values (moral, economic, social, epistemic) to particular colors, even 'people of color,' or material gradations, from light to dark? How does color function in a modern economy? What is its role in making subjectivity legible through its performance? How does color function as nonverbal communication that is affectively felt? To what degree is color a 'natural' or physical property and in what ways is it a rhetorical or cultural construction? And, how do institutions assign value to color?\u00a0\nSCHEDULE10:00-10:15am | WelcomeElizabeth Della Zazzera, Graduate Humanities Forum ChairNese Devenot, GHF Mellon Fellow\n10:15am-12:30pm | Panel DiscussionModerators: Jeannie Kenmotsu and Ting Fung Ho, GHF Mellon FellowsCommentators: Louise Daoust and Alan Niles, GHF Mellon Fellows\nRichard Doyle\nBy the Way, Which One's Pink?: On the Minimal Conditions for a Transmission of Philip K.

Called synesthesia, this human perceptual condition in which information between the senses is blended has long fascinated scientists and laypeople alike. Award-winning neuroscientist and New York Times bestselling author David Eagleman presents new findings from his research into the behavioral, neurological, and genetic characteristics of synesthetes.\nThere are an infinite number of boring things to do in science. But we live these short life spans. Why not do the thing that's the coolest thing in the world to do? \u2014David Eagleman, The New Yorker\n\nDavid Eagleman is best known for his work on time perception, synesthesia, and neurolaw. He directs the Laboratory for Perception and Action at the Baylor College of Medicine, whose goal is to understand how the brain constructs perception, how different brains do so differently, and how this matters for society. He also founded and directs Baylor's Initiative on Neuroscience and Law, which studies how new discoveries in neuroscience should navigate the way we make laws, punish criminals, and develop rehabilitation. And, he founded and is chief scientific officer for BrainCheck, a company that uses interactive testing on portable tablets to measure brain function, which schools are using to rapidly measure concussions at the sidelines.\nIn 2011, Eagleman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and that same year won the Eric Hoffer Book Award Montaigne Medal for his book Wednesday is Indigo Blue: Discovering the Brain of Synesthesia, coauthored with Richard Cytowic. In 2012 he was named Science Educator of the Year by the Society for Neuroscience, and was featured as one of the year's Brightest Idea Guys by Italy's Style Magazine. In 2014, he received the John J. McGovern Award for Excellence in Biomedical Education from the American Medical Writers' Association.\nOne of his latest books, Livewired: How the Brain Rewrites its Own Circuitry, is due in spring 2015 (Doubleday Canada). Also in Fall 2015, Eagleman will host the new PBS science series, \"The Brain with Dr. David Eagleman.\"\nFrom the Eagleman Laboratory website, in his own words:\"Public understanding of science is a passion of mine, and to that end I have written for the New York Times, Discover Magazine, Atlantic, The Week, Slate, Wired, New Scientist, and others. I speak often on National Public Radio and BBC to discuss what's new and important in science. I have founded a prize in mathematics and physics.\"I am fortunate to be a Guggenheim Fellow. Within the scientific community, I serve as an editor for Journal of Vision, PLoS One, and Seminars in Brain and Consciousness. I also serve on the board of directors for several organizations, including The Long Now Foundation.\"My book of fiction, Sum, was lucky enough to become an international bestseller. It has been translated into 27 languages and was named a Best Book of the Year by Barnes and Noble, New Scientist, and the Chicago Tribune. British musician Brian Eno and I performed a musical reading of Sum at the Sydney Opera House, and German composer Max Richter translated Sum into a full opera at the Royal Opera House in London.\"My neuroscience book Incognito became a New York Times bestseller, and was named a Book of the Year by Amazon, Goodreads, Houston Chronicle, and Boston Globe.

Now that the audience is assembled\u202f(Duke, 2018) is a prose poem that describes a fictional musical performance during which an unnamed musician improvises the construction of a series of invented instruments before an audience that is alternately contemplative, participatory, disputatious, and asleep. Both a work of literature and a study of music,\u202fNow that the audience is assembled\u202fexplores the categories of improvised music, solo performance, text scores, instrument building, aesthetic deskilling and reskilling, and the odd fate of the composer in experimental music. Grubbs\u2019s forthcoming The Voice in the Headphones (Duke, 2020) centers on the culture of the recording studio, presenting in intricate, prismatic detail one marathon day in a recording studio over the course of which an unnamed musician struggles to complete a film soundtrack. The Voice in the Headphones arrives at a moment in which the commercial recording studio shades into oblivion and is replaced by digital work environments; it draws upon Grubbs\u2019s own history of several decades as a recording artist, and its location could be described as every studio in which he has set foot. The experience of working in the recording studio is in large part the experience of the language that surrounds and infuses the world of the studio\u2014and that language is the material of this poem.\n\nAbout David Grubbs\n\nDavid Grubbs is Professor of Music at Brooklyn College and The Graduate Center, CUNY.\u00a0 At Brooklyn College he also teaches in the MFA programs in Performance and Interactive Media Arts (PIMA) and Creative Writing.\u00a0 He is the author of Now that the audience is assembled and Records Ruin the Landscape: John Cage, the Sixties, and Sound Recording\u00a0(both Duke University Press)and, with Anthony McCall, Simultaneous Soloists (Pioneer Works Press).\u00a0 In the spring of 2020, Duke University Press will publish The Voice in the Headphones, Grubbs\u2019s second experiment in music writing in the form of a book-length poem.\n\nGrubbs has released fourteen solo albums and appeared on more than 190 releases; his most recent solo recording is Creep Mission (Blue Chopsticks, 2017). In 2000, his The Spectrum Between\u00a0(Drag City) was named \u201cAlbum of the Year\u201d in the London Sunday Times.\u00a0 He is known for his ongoing cross-disciplinary collaborations with poet Susan Howe and visual artists Anthony McCall and Angela Bulloch, and his work has been presented at, among other venues, the Solomon R.

Linking practice and pedagogy, broader questions will be posed about disciplinary inheritance, educational ethics, and the problematic canons of the West.

Called \u201craw, elemental,\u201d and \u201crichly satisfying\u201d by The New York Times, her concert music and performance installations explore ritual acoustics, posthuman kink, and the micropolitics of noise. A finalist for the 2016 Pulitzer Prize in Music, Fure also won a Lincoln Center Emerging Artists Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Rome Prize in Music Composition, a DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Prize, a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grant for Artists, a Fulbright Fellowship to France, and a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship from Columbia University. Her work has been commissioned by major ensembles throughout Europe and the United States including The New York Philharmonic, The Los Angeles Philharmonic, Klangforum Wien, Ensemble Modern, Diotima Quartet, and the International Contemporary Ensemble.

The event will take place in room 101 of the Music Building (Lerner Center, 201 South 34th Street) on Tuesday November 19th at 5:15. Reception will follow. Below please find an abstract. We look forward to seeing many of you at this talk!\n\nWhen Richard Wagner created a lowered orchestra pit at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in the 1870s he famously described the decision in terms of concealment; an attempt to hide the means of sound production. In view of the modifications made to numerous opera houses in the decades that followed to create similar orchestra pits, scholars have tended to assume that the Festspielhaus was both the stimulus and model for such spaces. If this tends to flatten out important variations in architectural design between theaters, it also narrates the introduction of orchestra pits from the perspective of audience members alone. While lowered orchestral platforms might have functioned as so-called \u201cmystical chasms\u201d from which sound floated upwards towards awed spectators, these also had a crucial role in the creation of enclosed, protected spaces for musicians.\n\nThe 1907 construction of the so-called \u201cgolfo mistico\u201d at the preeminent Teatro alla Scala in Milan, under the supervision of Arturo Toscanini, was to a considerable extent an experiment in the creation of a more professional atmosphere than performance at audience level allowed. However much the term golfo mistico betrays a Romantic conception of the space, it was not, I argue, coincidental that the pit was constructed in the same moment that trade unions for musicians were establishing themselves. Meanwhile, musicians were also becoming familiar with other sorts of enclosures calibrated to control acoustics and eliminate distractions, in the form of the earliest sound studios. Placing La Scala\u2019s golfo mistico in the context of these dual developments in the Italian music industry at the time, I reveal the extent of the orchestra pit\u2019s entanglements in a musical landscape which increasingly placed musicians at one remove from their audiences; in tandem, I offer a new framework in which to make sense of the new (and enduring) fashion for this architectural innovation.", "endtime": "06:15 PM", "event_index": 492, "location": "", "owner": "Department of Music", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:15pm", "title": "Laura Protano-Biggs on the Teatro alla Scala in Milan", "url": "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/music/events/laura-protano-biggs-teatro-alla-scala-milan"},

This dystopian narrative has come to dominate political agendas across the globe. To save democracy \u2014 a number of voices argue \u2014 radical measures are needed. In this talk, Johan Farkas critically examines post-truth discourses, honing in on both the contemporary threats posed by disguised propaganda on social media and the risks of advancing undemocratic solutions to solve them.\nThe first part of the talk dives into the rise and proliferation of disguised propaganda on social media, drawing on empirical cases such as the Internet Research Agency in Russia and fake Muslim Facebook pages in Denmark. While disguised propaganda is not a new phenomenon in itself, the technological architecture of digital platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, enables new forms of manipulation, tactically exploiting interfaces, algorithmic proliferation, and content moderation policies. This poses novel challenges for democracy.\nDisguised propaganda in digital media have caused scholars, journalists, and politicians to talk about a post-truth crisis in dire need of fixing. Indeed, for many, truth must be restored at all costs, as democracy is founded on evidence-based decision-making. The second part of the talk critically engages with these post-truth discourses and the solutions they contain. Engaging with critical political philosophy, Farkas highlights how these \"democratic imaginaries\" neglect how democracy has never been about truth, evidence and rationality alone. It is equally about the voice of the democratic people. By neglecting this cornerstone of the democratic tradition, post-truth discourses reproduce and strengthen a risky vision of democracy \u2014 one in which consensus and rationality dominate over civic voices and popular dispute. By doing so, contemporary post-truth discourses \u2014 and the solutions they contain \u2014 might end up deepening existing democratic problems.\nThe talk is based on Farkas\u2019 new book, Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy: Mapping the Politics of Falsehood, written with Jannick Schou and published by Routledge.\nAbout the Speaker\nJohan Farkas is a Ph.D. Fellow in Media and Communication Studies at Malm\u00f6 University in Sweden. His research engages with the intersection of digital media platforms, disinformation, politics, journalism, and democracy. Farkas has published on these topics in international journals such as New Media & Society, Social Media + Society, and Critical Discourse Studies. In September 2019, his debut book, Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy: Mapping the Politics of Falsehood (with Jannick Schou) was published by Routledge. The book presents a detailed analysis of contemporary discourses of fake news and post-truth, offering both a trenchant critique and call for more inclusive forms of democracy. Farkas is currently Chair of the Young Scholars Network of the European Communication Research and Education Association (YECREA). You can learn more about his work on his website and follow him on Twitter @farkasjohan.\u00a0\nLunch begins at 11:45am. Space is limited.

Cooper\u2019s exhibit features work by two collaborators \u2014 conceptual immersive audio work by Rutgers University doctoral student Katie Gressitt-Diaz and a traditional still photo series by photographer Kyle Cassidy \u2014 as well as an actual cryptocurrency mining operation, immersed in a liquid cooling bath, that will produce blockchain as viewers watch.\nJoin us for a gallery tour of the exhibit and a short lecture by Cooper on Tuesday, October 22 at 5pm. This event is part of Energy Week @ Penn and is sponsored by the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy.\nThe exhibit is open and on display through May 2020, and is part of Penn's Year of Data.\nAbout the Project\n\u201cAlchemical Infrastructures: Making Blockchain in Iceland\u201d explores not the mining of cryptocurrency, as it\u2019s conventionally thought of, but rather the complicated, difficult, political, and energy-intensive practice of making cryptocurrency in Iceland; a combinatory process of infrastructures, social systems, political institutions, and desires, all intentionally brought together in search of new monetary futures \u2014 or in other words, alchemy. Not unlike medieval alchemists, those building cryptocurrency and blockchain architectures must follow complicated recipes, conjuring the right assemblage of machine, human, and environment that will yield the greatest value \u2014 a value often dictated by and through energy costs and availability. In search of a sort of digital philosopher\u2019s stone, the blockchain alchemists flock to regions where the Earth sings with natural energy in order to mix and mingle their hardware \u2014 regions like Iceland. \u00a0\nThe exhibit examines the work of Iceland\u2019s blockchain alchemists by assembling and mixing different modes of qualitative research in an attempt to synthesize an understanding of what the practice of blockchain looks, feels, smells, and sounds like. The exhibit is loosely structured around an experimental documentary film, produced in 360-degree immersive video, that attempts to materialize, spatialize, and personalize the experience of blockchain in Iceland through the blending of multiple voices and stakeholders. Taking a multi-sited, network ethnographic approach, and through the lens of situational analysis, the film places blockchain in Iceland within a larger situation of action. The immersive juxtaposition and blending of environmental, industrial, and infrastructural spaces will educate viewers on the embedded complexities of blockchain as a system, illustrating how large technocratic imaginaries (like blockchain) are locally negotiated.\nWhile the film accentuates the visual and spatial experiences of blockchain in Iceland, the conceptual sound work by Katie Gressitt-Diaz brings the complex aural dimensions of this project into sharp relief. Sometimes we may feel it somewhere in our bones, or on the backs of our necks, but we often do not consciously consider sound\u2019s profound influence, and its communicative, affective power. Gressitt-Diaz\u2019s contributions to this exhibit will explore the variated and entangled sonic environments conjured forth in the alchemical making of cryptocurrency.\nAs both the film and the conceptual sound work endeavor to highlight friction, tension, entanglement, and collaboration, the photo series by Kyle Cassidy personalizes individual experiences of making blockchain in Iceland. Through Cassidy\u2019s photos, the turbulent ecology of cryptocurrency, energy, and earth is temporarily frozen in order to bring into focus the personal stakes, ambitions, and passions of those involved in Iceland\u2019s cryptocurrency ecology. In Cassidy\u2019s contribution, instead of the individual emerging from the situation, we see the situation brought forth through the individual.\nLastly, a Bitmain Antminer S7 cryptocurrency mining device is included as a material anchor, as well as the fourth active contributor to the exhibit. While the rest of the exhibit was produced digitally and can effectively be downloaded in its entirety, the cryptocurrency-producing Antminer is the only element of the show that is fundamentally not digitally native, and whose specific setup cannot be reproduced. As such, it is a tangible assemblage of potential value, actively combining and mixing with Penn\u2019s local infrastructure in search of Auroracoin, Iceland\u2019s unofficial national cryptocurrency. Throughout the year, Cooper will trace both how many coins the machine has produced, and how much energy it has used.\nThere are profound limits to how much the traditional academic article or monograph can communicate. Innovating the presentation of scholarship with tools like immersive video, conceptual audio, and photography can help illustrate socio-material affects and complexities that become obscured in traditional academic writing. Part of what this exhibit hopes to accomplish is to introduce new possibilities for conceptualizing and presenting our relationship to infrastructure, and to open up questions about how new ways of seeing can produce more just, equitable, and sustainable futures.", "endtime": "7:00pm", "event_index": 495, "location": "Annenberg School Forum", "owner": "Annenberg School of Communication", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:00pm", "title": "Gallery Tour \u2014 \"Alchemical Infrastructures: Making Blockchain in Iceland\"", "url": "https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/events/blockchain-gallery-tour"},

    {"date": "25 Oct 2019 - 12:00pm to 1:00pm", "date_dt": "25-10-2019", "description": "About the Talk\nWhy do people believe and share misinformation, including entirely fabricated news headlines (\u201cfake news\u201d) and biased or misleading coverage of actual events (\"hyper-partisan\" content)? The dominant narrative in the media and among academics is that we believe misinformation because we want to \u2014 that is, we engage in motivated reasoning, using our cognitive capacities to convince ourselves of the truth of statements that align with our political ideology rather than to undercover the truth. In a series of survey experiments using American participants, David Rand and colleagues challenged this account. They consistently found that subjects who perform better on the Cognitive Reflection Test (a measure of the tendency to engage in analytic thinking) are better able to identify false or biased headlines \u2014 even for headlines that align with individuals\u2019 political ideology (for details, see here and here). They also found that when examining actual Twitter behavior, more reflective individuals share information from higher quality news sources. These findings suggest that susceptibility to misinformation is driven more by mental laziness and lack of reasoning than it is by partisan bias hijacking the reasoning process. They then build on this observation to examine interventions to fight the spread of misinformation. In one, they show that laypeople are much less biased in their evaluation of the trustworthiness of news outlets than one might imagine, and give fake news and hyperpartisan outlets low trust ratings regardless of their political slant. Thus, using crowdsourced ratings of outlet quality to inform social media ranking algorithms is a promising approach (for details, see here). Second, the researchers demonstrate the power of making the concept of accuracy top-of-mind, thereby increasing the likelihood that people think about the accuracy of headlines before they decide whether to share them. Rand's results suggest that reasoning is not held hostage by partisan bias, but that instead participants do have the ability to tell fake or inaccurate from real \u2014 if they bother to pay attention. The findings also suggest simple, cost-effective behavioral interventions to fight the spread of misinformation.\nAbout the Speaker\nDavid G. Rand is the Erwin H. Schell Professor and an Associate Professor of Management Science and Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT Sloan, and the Director of the Human Cooperation Laboratory and the Applied Cooperation Team.\nBridging the fields of behavioral economics and psychology, Rand\u2019s research combines mathematical/computational models with human behavioral experiments and online/field studies to understand human behavior. His work uses a cognitive science perspective grounded in the tension between more intuitive versus deliberative modes of decision-making, and explores topics such as cooperation/prosociality, punishment/condemnation, perceived accuracy of false or misleading news stories, political preferences, and the dynamics of social media platform behavior.

If infrastructure conditions how information, people, and things circulate, then what might the practices of concealment tell us about the political stakes of circulation, and about the nature of our infrastructural surround? What kinds of visual forms emerge in global media events in which concealment is crucial part, sometimes even the condition of possibility for targetable people and equipment to stay on air. This colloquium examines these contradictions in the context of Lebanon, where infrastructural disrepair and breakdown parallel political impasses and fragmentation. It takes the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year as its case study. Based on fieldwork and visual analysis, El-Hibri examines how concealment structures phenomena ranging from live satellite news broadcasts, drone-cam footage, signal jamming and hacking, and online guerilla video from the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year. He shows how televisual liveness in this event \u2014 that new-again promise to see things faraway as they happen \u2014 demonstrates how the geopolitics of simultaneity has transformed in the contemporary moment.\nAbout the Speaker\nHatim El-Hibri is a\u00a0Faculty Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication and an\u00a0Assistant Professor of Film and Media at George Mason University.

In his book,\u00a0The Palestinian Idea, Greg Burris argues that it is precisely through film and media that hope can occasionally emerge amidst hopelessness, emancipation amidst oppression, freedom amidst apartheid. The author employs the work of Edward W. Said, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, and Cedric J. Robinson in order to locate Palestinian utopia in the heart of the Zionist present. He analyzes the films of prominent directors Annemarie Jacir (Salt of This Sea,\u00a0When I Saw You) and Hany Abu-Assad (Paradise Now) to investigate the emergence and formation of Palestinian identity. Looking at Mais Darwazah\u2019s documentary\u00a0My Love Awaits Me by the Sea, Burris considers the counterhistories that make up the Palestinian experience\u2014stories and memories that have otherwise been obscured or denied. He also examines Palestinian (in)visibility in the global media landscape, and how issues of Black-Palestinian transnational solidarity are illustrated through social media, staged news spectacles, and hip hop music.\u00a0\n\"A deeply felt, brilliantly conceived, meticulously crafted book,\u00a0The Palestinian Idea\u00a0breaks new ground in how we understand vision, space, and identity. Greg Burris's work is an important contribution to Arab and global media studies.\" \u2014Marwan M. Kraidy, Anthony Shadid Chair in Global Media, Politics and Culture at the University of Pennsylvania and author of\u00a0The Naked Blogger of Cairo: Creative Insurgency in the Arab World\u00a0\n\u00a0\"Greg Burris has written the book so many people have been waiting for\u2014and he's done it in sharp and readable prose. Situating Palestine in relation to various global revolutionary movements and animating Palestine's own revolutionary identity, Burris has managed the rare feat of producing scholarship that is both timeless and topical. By so thoroughly and imaginatively exploring the idea of Palestine, he illuminates exactly how real Palestine is.\" \u2014Steven Salaita, author of\u00a0Israel's Dead Soul\nAbout the Speaker\nGreg Burris is a film and cultural theorist whose work focuses on race, media, and emancipatory politics.

How is certain novel information about the world nevertheless made meaningful in their everyday lives? While a growing number of studies have focused on the role of multi-platform mobile technology in young people\u2019s daily experiences, few studies have aimed to reconceptualize news from this perspective, paying particular attention to the phenomenology of news perception in the digital age. Such a reconceptualization is all the more important since the basic dimensions of phenomenology \u2013 namely, time, space and cultural relevance \u2013 coincide with the basic dimensions of news as a cultural form. This talk will draw from ongoing fieldwork with college students in Kazan, Russia, focusing particularly on the challenges of conducting a \u201cnews reception\u201d study when what counts as \u201cnews\u201d is not separable from the rest of their coming-of-age experiences on and offline.\nNatalia Roudakova is a cultural anthropologist (Ph.D., Stanford University, 2007) working in the fields of political communication, journalism, and media studies, with an interest in moral philosophy and political and cultural theory. Roudakova has a broad international research and teaching profile, having worked as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Communication, University of California in San Diego; as Visiting Professor at Erasmus University in Rotterdam (Netherlands); and as Researcher in the Department of Communication at S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University, Sweden.\nIn 2013-2014, Roudakova was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Alto, California, where she completed her award-winning book,\u00a0Losing Pravda: Ethics and the Press in Post-Truth Russia\u00a0(Cambridge University Press, 2017).\u00a0Losing Pravda\u00a0examines the spectacular professional unraveling of journalism in Russia during the 1990s and 2000s and its societal ramifications. More broadly,\u00a0Losing Pravda\u00a0tracks how a post-truth society comes into being, illuminating the historical and cultural emergence of \u201cfake news,\u201d disinformation (kompromat), and general distrust in politics and public life.\nRoudakova\u2019s new research is focused on the phenomenology of news perception in the digital age.

Through a consideration of the television set\u2019s intertwining with devices ranging from VCRs to set-top boxes and optical-fiber cables, Chirumamilla exposes new veins of analysis through which we might understand both the inter-media history within which television in South India is embedded and the kinds of mediated futures that television\u2019s material transformations portend.\n\u00a0\nFollowing an overview of her larger project, which utilizes both ethnographic research and close textual analysis of newspapers, enthusiast magazines, and policy documents, Chirumamilla will turn her focus to the objects of the television set, the videotape, and the VCR. How does looking at these objects in concert with each other change our imagining of the historical trajectory of television in South India? She will argue that the television set\u2019s entanglement with videotapes and the VCR is illustrative of the contentious, close relationship between the commercial cinema industry and television\u2019s growing presence within the lives of Indian media consumers; an entanglement that has so far gone understudied and might offer us new ways to think about how we theorize the pasts and futures of media technologies.\n\u00a0\n\nAbout the Speaker\nPadma Chirumamilla\u00a0is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication. Her work examines how media infrastructures shape and are shaped by everyday cultural life and labor in postcolonial South India and the broader Global South. Her dissertation investigates how the television \u2014 both the physical object and the broader media entity \u2014 were integrated into the daily rhythms of viewers and media workers in small-town and rural regions in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, through venues like the repair shop and technologies likes the videotape and VCR. Through a combination of ethnographic and textually-based methods, Chirumamilla\u2019s research considers how the materiality of media shapes its absorption into the routines and rhythms of everyday life in the Global South. She is also interested in notions of technological futurity, and how the futuristic allure of digital technologies configures everyday encounters with media infrastructures in the Global South. Chirumamilla is a first-generation postsecondary scholar. She received her Ph.D. in Information Studies from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in the summer of 2019. She obtained an M.A. in South and Southeast Asian Studies from the University of California, Berkeley, and a B.A. in English Language and Literature from the University of Chicago.\u00a0\nLunch begins at 11:45.\u00a0Space is limited, RSVP to\u00a0marina.krikorian@asc.upenn.edu.", "endtime": "1:00pm", "event_index": 506, "location": "3901 Walnut Street, 6th Floor", "owner": "Annenberg School of Communication", "speaker": " Padma Chirumamilla, Annenberg School", "starttime": "12:00pm", "title": "CARGC Colloquium: Padma Chirumamilla, Annenberg School", "url": "https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/events/cargc-colloquium-padma-chirumamilla"},

Game theory classically studies Nash equilibrium as the outcome of selfish interaction, and has many examples illustrating that selfish behavior can lead to suboptimal outcome for all participants. Over the last decade, we developed good understanding how to quantify the impact of strategic user behavior on overall performance in Nash equilibria of games. In this talk we will focus on games where players use a form of learning that helps them adapt to the environment.

While conventional wisdom often takes a dim view of nonconvex optimization algorithms due to their susceptibility to spurious local minima, simple iterative methods such as gradient descent have been remarkably successful in practice. The theoretical footings, however, had been largely lacking until recently. This talk presents two recent stories about nonconvex statistical estimation, which highlight the important role of statistical models in enabling efficient nonconvex optimization. The first story is about randomly initialized nonconvex methods for a phase retrieval problem: even without careful initialization, simple algorithms like gradient descent provably find the global solution within a logarithmic number of iterations. The second story is concerned with uncertainty quantification for nonconvex low-rank matrix completion. We develop a de-biased estimator \u2014 on the basis of a nonconvex estimate \u2014 that enables optimal construction of confidence intervals for the missing entries of the unknown matrix. All of this is achieved via a leave-one-out statistical analysis framework, which is very powerful in handling and decoupling complicated statistical dependency.\nThis is joint work with Cong Ma, Yuling Yan, Yuejie Chi, and Jianqing Fan.", "endtime": "4:00 PM", "event_index": 677, "location": "Room 401B, 3401 Walnut,  3401 Walnut Street", "owner": "School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS)", "speaker": "Yuxin Chen\nAssistant Professor in Electrical Engineering at Princeton University\nYuxin Chen is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University.

For these applications, visual-inertial odometry is a common way to localize the vehicles and observe the environment. However, unlike with wheeled mobile robots, quadrotor localization algorithms often do not use knowledge of the control inputs and the full vehicle dynamics as a process model for localization. Rather, they use kinematic models, with the IMU providing acceleration and angular velocity. One of the reasons for avoiding the use of dynamics is that, until recently quadrotor aerodynamic effects have not been considered in the literature and hence the dynamic models for quadrotors have been less accurate than those for wheeled mobile robots. The main aerodynamic terms that are significant are first-order effects that are linear in velocity and angular velocity. They are predominantly caused by aerodynamic interaction with the spinning propellers. This work investigates the models for such effects, as well as what can be gained if such aerodynamic effects are incorporated into the dynamic model and the full dynamics are used for state estimation. We develop novel IMU-based filters, the end results of which are used to estimate the wind velocity of the quadrotor or, indoors, when the ambient wind is zero, the velocity of the quadrotor. In addition, these filters estimate the many aerodynamic parameters in the model online. They may also be used to estimate sensor biases and inertial parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these filters through experiments. We also present nonlinear observability analyses that theoretically determine the observability properties of the systems.\nCommittee Members:\nVijay Kumar, Nemirovsky Family Dean of Engineering\nAni Hsieh, Research Associate Professor, MEAM\nKostas Daniliidis,\u00a0Ruth Yalom Stone Professor, CIS\nCamillo J.

While these systems provide high-quality images, the improved functionality comes at the cost of increased size and weight. One route to reduce a system\u2019s complexity is via computational imaging, in which much of the aberration correction and functionality of the optical hardware is shifted to post-processing in the software realm. Alternatively, a designer could miniaturize the optics by replacing them with diffractive optical elements, which mimic the functionality of refractive systems in a more compact form factor. Metasurfaces are an extreme example of such diffractive elements, in which quasiperiodic arrays of resonant subwavelength optical antennas impart spatially-varying changes on a wavefront. While separately both computational imaging and metasurfaces are promising avenues toward simplifying optical systems, a synergistic combination of these fields can further enhance system performance and facilitate advanced capabilities.

Platelet aggregation is largely a physical process while coagulation is biochemical, consisting of a large network of reactions that culminate in the generation of the enzyme thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin, which polymerizes into fibers to form a stabilizing gel matrix in and around growing platelet aggregates. Thrombin also (re)binds directly to fibrin but this interaction, and its purpose, is not fully understood. Thrombin-fibrin binding is often described as two independent, single-step binding events, one high-affinity and one low-affinity, each through a different exosite on thrombin. However, kinetic schemes describing these single-step binding events with reported kinetic rate constants cannot explain experimentally-observed residency times of fibrin-bound thrombin. In this work, we study a bivalent, sequential-step binding scheme as an alternative to the high-affinity event, and in addition to the low-affinity one. We developed mathematical models for the single- and sequential-step schemes consisting of reaction-diffusion equations to compare to each other and to previously published experimental data. We then used Bayesian inference, in the form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo, to learn model parameter distributions from the experimental data. For the model to best fit the data, we needed an additional assumption that thrombin was irreversibly sequestered; we hypothesized that this could be due to thrombin becoming physically trapped within fibrin fibers as they formed. We also discuss how our model can be used to further probe scenarios dealing with thrombin allostery.", "endtime": "3:00 PM", "event_index": 691, "location": "Towne 337", "owner": "Penn Institute for Computational Science (PICS)", "speaker": "Karin Leiderman\nAssociate Professor, Director of Graduate Studies, Department of Applied Math & Statistics, Colorado School of Mines\nKarin Leiderman is an Associate Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Colorado School of Mines.

    {"date": "November 22 2019", "date_dt": "22-11-2019", "description": "Abstract: Organic molecular crystals frequently exist in multiple forms known as polymorphs. Structural differences between crystal polymorphs can affect desired properties, such as bioavailability of active pharmaceutical formulations, lethality of pesticides, or electrical conductivity of organic semiconductors. Crystallization conditions can influence polymorph selection, making an experimentally driven hunt for polymorphs difficult. Such efforts are further complicated when polymorphs initially obtained under a particular experimental protocol \u201cdisappear\u201d in favor of another polymorph in subsequent repetitions of the experiment. Consequently, theory and computational can potentially play a vital role in mapping the landscape of crystal polymorphism. Traditional crystal structure prediction methods face their own challenges, and therefore, new approaches are needed. In this talk, I will show, by leveraging concepts from mathematics and statistical mechanics in combination with techniques of molecular simulation, traditional methods, and machine learning, that a new paradigm in crystal structure prediction may be emerging. Examples demonstrating prediction of structures of crystals, co-crystals, and phase transitions will be presented.", "endtime": "3:00 PM", "event_index": 698, "location": "Towne 337", "owner": "Penn Institute for Computational Science (PICS)", "speaker": "Mark Tuckerman\nProfessor of Chemistry And Mathematics at New York University", "starttime": "2:00 PM", "title": "PICS Seminar: \u201cMolecular Simulation and Machine Learning as Routes to Exploring Structure and Phase Behavior in Atomic and Molecular Crystals\u201d", "url": "https://events.seas.upenn.edu/event/pics-seminar-molecular-simulation-and-machine-learning-as-routes-to-exploring-structure-and-phase-behavior-in-atomic-and-molecular-crystals/"},

To address this problem, we propose a paradigm shift. The current paradigm centers on generating one estimate at a time using a unique study design with unknown reliability and publishing (or not) one estimate at a time. The new paradigm advocates for high-throughput observational studies using consistent and standardized methods, allowing evaluation, calibration, and unbiased dissemination to generate a more reliable and complete evidence base. We demonstrate this new paradigm by comparing all hypertension treatments for a set of effectiveness and safety outcomes, producing 587,020 hazard ratios, each using methodology on par with state-of-the-art studies. We furthermore include control hypotheses to evaluate and calibrate our evidence generation process. Results agree with the limited number of randomized trials.

In simple models, causal parameters of interest are identified by variations of the functional known as the g-formula, and estimated using parametric and semi-parametric frameworks for statistical inference. Identification by the g-formula, and subsequent estimation methods in fully observed models have a clean interpretation in terms of the Markov factorization with respect to a directed acyclic graph (DAG). I show that this interpretation may be extended to arbitrary hidden variable causal models using a more involved nested Markov factorization with respect to a directed mixed graph. This view leads to a simple characterization of non-parametric identification for many parameters in causal inference, including causal effects, direct, indirect, and path-specific effects, responses to counterfactual policies, and many others. In addition, the nested Markov factorization avoids certain paradoxes associated with causal nulls, and leads to well-behaved model likelihoods that avoid making assumptions on unobserved variables, while capturing the structure these variables induce on the observed marginal distribution. This structure takes the form of all equality constraints induced by the hidden variable model, including conditional independences and \u201cVerma constraints.\u201d These restrictions may be used to make statistical inference more computationally tractable via probabilistic calculation procedures that generalize variable elimination algorithms in machine learning.", "endtime": "5:30 pm", "event_index": 804, "location": "F45 Huntsman Hall", "owner": "Wharton Statistics Seminars", "speaker": "Ilya Shpitser \u2013 Johns Hopkins University", "starttime": "4:30pm", "title": "Identification and Estimation of Causal Parameters via a Modified Factorization of a Graphical Model", "url": "https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/identification-and-estimation-of-causal-parameters-via-a-modified-factorization-of-a-graphical-model"},

In this talk, I will show that the same graphical criterions can be used in arbitrary causal diagrams when the goal is to minimize the asymptotic variance of non-parametric estimators of ATE that ignore the causal diagram assumptions. Furthermore, I will provide a graphical criterion to determine the optimal adjustment set among the minimal adjustment sets. In addition, I will provide another graphical criterion for determining when a non-parametric estimator of ATE is as efficient as an efficient estimator that exploits the causal diagram assumptions.

Methods for assessing the\u00a0sensitivity\u00a0of a study\u2019s conclusions to unmeasured confounding have been devised for testing sharp null hypotheses, most commonly that the treatment effect is constant across all individuals. It has been argued that certain patterns of hidden bias may be directly attributable to the existence of heterogeneous treatment effects, stoking fear that sensitivity analyses assuming constant effects may be inadequate. We present a new method for\u00a0sensitivity\u00a0analysis\u00a0for the sample average treatment effect in paired observational studies while leaving the individual-level treatment effects unspecified. Our recommended procedure relates recent work on\u00a0robust\u00a0permutation tests to observational studies, where randomizations are no longer drawn uniformly. The method naturally extends conventional modes of inference for the sample average treatment effect in paired experiments to the case of unknown, but bounded, probabilities of assignment to treatment.

Its causal identification relies on the assumption of parallel trends, which is scale dependent and may be questionable in some applications. A common alternative is a regression model that adjusts for the lagged dependent variable, which rests on the assumption of ignorability conditional on past outcomes. In this paper, we show a general nonparametric bracketing relationship between the difference-in-differences and lagged-dependent-variable regression estimates, under testable assumptions. Namely, for a true positive effect, if ignorability is correct, then mistakenly assuming parallel trends will overestimate the effect; in contrast, if the parallel trends assumption is correct, then mistakenly assuming ignorability will underestimate the effect. This provides a general strategy to construct bounds for the treatment effects. We provide three examples to illustrate the theoretical results.

A key theoretical and practical assumption of most methods, however, is that they have access to independent samples from the entire distribution of relevant data. As such, these methods often fail catastrophically in the face of biased data which breaks this assumption. In this talk, we focus on bias due to censoring or truncation, where samples falling outside of an \u201cobservation window\u201d are unreliable or cannot be observed due e.g. to measurement errors, legal or privacy constraints, or biased data collection. We present a general framework based on stochastic gradient descent for regression and classification from truncated samples. While the framework is broadly applicable, we also instantiate it to obtain computationally and statistically efficient methods for truncated density estimation and truncated linear, logistic and probit regression in high dimensions. We also provide experiments to illustrate the practicality of our framework on synthetic and real data.

This practice, termed post-selection inference in the statistical literature, may negatively affect both point estimation and uncertainty quantification in A/B testing, and therefore hinder trustworthy decision making. To address this issue, we explore two seemingly unrelated paths, one based on supervised machine learning and the other on empirical Bayes, and propose post-selection inferential approaches that combine the strengths of both. Via large-scale simulated and empirical examples, we demonstrate that our proposed methodologies stand out among other existing methods in both reducing post-selection biases and improving confidence interval coverage rates, and discuss how they can be conveniently adjusted to real-life scenarios.", "endtime": "5:30 pm", "event_index": 810, "location": "F45 Huntsman Hall", "owner": "Wharton Statistics Seminars", "speaker": "Alex (Shaojie) Deng \u2013 Microsoft Analysis and Experimentation Team", "starttime": "4:30pm", "title": "Trustworthy Post-selection Inference in A/B Testing", "url": "https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/trustworthy-post-selection-inference-in-a-b-testing"},

This privacy definition, however, has some well-known weaknesses: notably, it does not tightly handle composition. This weakness has inspired several recent relaxations of differential privacy based on Renyi divergences. We propose an alternative relaxation of differential privacy, which we term \u201cf-DP\u201d, which has a number of nice properties and avoids some of the difficulties associated with divergence based relaxations. First, it preserves the hypothesis testing interpretation of differential privacy, which makes its guarantees easily interpretable. It allows for lossless reasoning about composition and post-processing, and notably, a direct way to analyze privacy amplification by subsampling. We define a canonical single-parameter family of definitions within our class that is termed \u201cGaussian Differential Privacy\u201d, based on hypothesis testing of two shifted normal distributions. We prove that this family is focal to f-DP by introducing a central limit theorem, which shows that the privacy guarantees of any hypothesis-testing based definition of privacy (including differential privacy) converge to Gaussian differential privacy in the limit under composition. This central limit theorem also gives a tractable analysis tool. We demonstrate the use of the tools we develop by giving an improved analysis of the privacy guarantees of noisy stochastic gradient descent.

He studied architecture intermittently at the then Regent Street Polytechnic School of Architecture (now the University of Westminster) between the years 1953 and 1972; a somewhat lengthy student career. A project he designed during his fourth year at the Polytechnic found its way, owing to a curious set of circumstances, into an exhibition at MoMA New York entitled \"Visionary Architecture\" in 1960. The following year his thesis project for an entertainments center in the middle of London was repeatedly failed at the Poly; nevertheless it became widely published, and was featured in November 2009 at the \"First Projects\" exhibition at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London.\nIn 1961, he was invited by Sir Peter Cook to be part of an assortment of young architects who referred to themselves as the Archigram group, publishing a magazine with the same title. The group rebelled against what it saw as the failure of the architectural establishment in Britain to produce buildings reflecting the dynamic changes, both technological and social, the country was then undergoing. For the last 26 years a large exhibition of the group\u2019s work has been touring world capitals; and in 2006 Archigram was awarded the Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects.\nWebb emigrated to the USA in 1965. He sees his raison d'etre as deriving from the drawings he has produced over the years: among these being the Temple Island Study, which resulted in an eponymously titled book published by the AA in 1987; and the Drive-in House series. A monograph entitled Two Journeys was published in 2018.. His writing has appeared many times in Architectural Design magazine, Daidalos, and in the Journal of Architectural Education.\nHe has had one man shows at the Cooper Union, Columbia University, the Storefront Gallery in NY, the Architecture League in NY, the University of Manitoba at Winnipeg, and the Art Net Gallery in London.

Before joining the Faculty at the Weitzman School, she was the Frieda L. Miller Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced study at Harvard University.\nToday Austrian architect Margarete Sch\u00fctte-Lihotzky (1897-2000) is widely recognized as one of the pioneering female figures in modern design, who worked in Vienna, Frankfurt, the Soviet Union, and Turkey in the 1920s and 1930s. Yet, these decades of professional work were marked by a drastic break between 1940 and 1945, when Sch\u00fctte-Lihotzky was interned for her participation in the Communist resistance against by the Nazi regime. Her recollections from the years of internment became the subject of the 1984 German-language book Erinnerungen aus dem Widerstand (Memories of the Resistance), currently edited by Hochh\u00e4usl and translated by Raphael Koenig and Christianna Bonnin.\nThe lecture \u201cMemories of the Resistance\u201d explores Sch\u00fctte-Lihotzky\u2019s book as a critical historical document that exemplifies the spatialization of organized dissent in the 1940s. It also provides a glimpse into resistance as lived practice and how it became activated by human solidarity and collective action. Finally, the lecture comments on why Sch\u00fctte-Lihotzky\u2019s activism led to the ostracization of the important architect in postwar Austria, where her struggle for spaces of collective memorialization remains largely forgotten until today. The talk will include excerpted readings from the English language book, which is currently edited and translated by Sophie Hochh\u00e4usl, Raphael Koenig, and Christianna Bonin.\nHochh\u00e4usl\u2019s scholarly work centers on modern architecture and urban culture in Austria, Germany, and the United States,\u00a0with a focus on the history of social movements, environmental history, and women\u2019s and gender studies. Currently, she is working on two forthcoming book projects. The monograph\u00a0Housing Cooperative: Politics and Architecture in Vienna, 1904-1934, which\u00a0elucidates the role of cooperatives in shaping architectural debates in interwar Vienna. The interdisciplinary history and translation project\u00a0Memories of the Resistance: Women, War, and the Forgotten Work of Margarete Sch\u00fctte-Lihotzky, 1938-1989, illuminates the Austrian architect\u2019s participation in the Communist resistance against the Nazi regime.\nIn the past Hochh\u00e4usl has received a Carter Manny Award and the Bruno Zevi Award. Her research has been supported by the Graham Foundation, the Botstiber Foundation for Austrian-American Studies, the Clarence Stein Fellowship for Landscape and Urban Studies, the Society for the Humanities at Cornell University, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, the Austrian Federal Ministry for Education and the Viennese Mayor\u2019s Office.\nHochh\u00e4usl holds an M.Arch. from the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and an M.A. and Ph.D. from Cornell University in History of Architecture and Urbanism.\u00a0Together with Torsten Lange (ETH Z\u00fcrich), she organizes the European Architectural History Network\u2019s interest group Architecture and the Environment.\nThis event is free and open to the public.

Millions of people inhabited thousands of settlements, divided among more than a hundred kingdoms. By controlling water resources and terraforming the landscape they developed an agricultural system that supported a ruling class of king and, nobles, as well as strata of artists, architects, potters, merchants, and warriors. But at about 800 things began to go seriously wrong and within a century all their great cities were abandoned, never to be reoccupied. One of the great problems of world archaeology, this catastrophe has never lacked theories, what it lacked was hard facts pointing to an explanation. But today we might finally be close to understanding what happened and laying a mystery to rest.\nNEW!

This earthquake is conventionally dated to the morning of July 21, 365 CE. However, this neat picture of a single, universally-destructive event is open to question, for it is difficult to resolve the textual, archaeological, and geological evidence for seismological activity in the second half of the fourth century into a single, coherent picture.
