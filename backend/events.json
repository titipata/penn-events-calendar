For example, distinct neuroanatomical substrates have been proposed for declarative memory versus perceptual learning, short-term versus long-term memory, and familiarity versus recollection. I will present theoretical and empirical work, including connectionist simulations, behavioral studies and fMRI data, that challenges process-based accounts of memory and visual cognition. Instead, I will argue that the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe (MTL) can be understood in terms of a hierarchy of representations \u2013 from simple features in V1, through feature-conjunctions in inferior temporal cortex, to complex conjunctions of items and context in MTL. Under this view, the processes that operate upon the representations to produce a behavioral output \u2013 e.g., \u201cpattern completion\u201d to produce recall of a memory \u2013 can occur anywhere along the hierarchy.The studies I will present demonstrate how a single brain region can support more than one cognitive process (visual discrimination and recognition memory); that a cognitive process (recollection) previously thought tied to one brain region (hippocampus) can also unfold elsewhere; and that this \u201cRepresentational-Hierarchical\u201d framework makes accurate predictions for the organization of representations within the ventral visual stream, and for the effects of aging on recognition memory. This suggests that it may be possible to banish the ghosts of process from the neural machinery of memory, and explain the neuroanatomical organization of cognition in terms of representations alone.", "endtime": "12:30 PM", "event_id": "", "location": "Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building", "owner": "Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI)", "speaker": "Rosie Cowell", "starttime": "11:30 AM", "summary": "", "title": "Banishing Ghosts of Process from the Neural Machinery of Human Memory: A Representational Hierarchical Account of Cognition", "url": "https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-rosie-cowell", "date_dt": "26-02-2019"}

These requirements exceed the capabilities of available neurotechnologies: non-invasive clinical tools provide coarse, indirect measurements of collective neural network behavior, but they fail to identify the microcircuits underlying function and disease. Implantable metal and silicon electrodes can directly interface with individual neurons, but suffer from poor longevity and invasiveness issues. Genetically-encoded tools for optically monitoring and manipulating neural activity, are beginning to reveal the brain\u2019s wiring, but alone they provide sparse information on \u201cfast\u201d circuit activity and network connectivity.In this talk I will discuss how nanoscale materials can be engineered into high-resolution, minimally invasive, multimodal neuroelectronic interfaces, designed to seamlessly interface with and control the activity of neural circuits. In the first part of the talk I will present high-resolution, low noise microelectrodes based on MXene nanomaterials. I will illustrate the fundamental electrochemical properties of MXene nanomaterials compared to conventional metals and how these translate into significant impedance and noise reduction when MXenes are integrated into cellular-scale devices. I will then present two examples of custom-fabricated MXene microelectrodes optimized for neural recordings in different areas of the brain. In the second part of the talk I will introduce flexible, transparent graphene optoelectronic devices engineered to simultaneously acquire electrophysiology and functional calcium imaging data. I will present the fabrication process yielding functional electrodes with >90% broadband transparency and demonstrate their application in multimodal mapping seizure dynamics at high-spatiotemporal resolution, in vivo in animal models of epilepsy.", "endtime": "12:30 PM", "event_id": "", "location": "Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building", "owner": "Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI)", "speaker": "Flavia Vitale", "starttime": "11:30 AM", "summary": "", "title": "When nano meets neuro: high-resolution interfaces for multimodal mapping neural circuit dynamic", "url": "https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-flavia-vitale", "date_dt": "19-02-2019"}
{"date": "Thursday, February 14, 2019 - 11:30am", "description": "Auditory Neurophysiology LaboratoryUniversity of SalamancaEmergence of deviance detection along the auditory neuroaxis and beyond: A neuronal correlate for predictive coding?The soundscape consists of a cacophony of multiple sources of sounds with complex properties overlapping temporally and spectrally. Nonetheless, what we can hear is an orderly acoustic stream organised according to sources and auditory objects, allowing us to distinguish deviant or novel events and select some sources or objects for further processing. Recent evidence suggests that these perceptual achievements are based on properties that are encoded at earlier stages of the auditory pathway.Stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) is the reduction in the responses to a common sound relative to the same sound when rare. It was originally described in the primary auditory cortex (A1) as the neuronal correlate of the mismatch negativity (MMN), an important component of the auditory event-related potentials that is elicited by changes in the auditory environment. However, the relationship between SSA and the MMN is still a subject of debate. The MMN is a mid-late potential (~150-200 ms in humans), and its neural sources have been located mainly within non-primary auditory cortex in humans and animal models. Moreover, SSA is also present as early as in the auditory midbrain and thalamus (IC and MGB).In this talk, I will show our recent findings on recordings from single neurons in the IC, MGB and auditory cortex (AC) of anaesthetized rats and awake mouse to an oddball paradigm similar to that used for MMN studies. Our data demonstrate that most neurons in the non-lemnical divisions of the auditory brain show strong SSA and that there is a hierarchical emergence of prediction error signals along the central auditory system. We have also observed that although GABAergic and/or glycinergic inhibition play a role in modulating SSA in the IC and MGB, it is acetylcholine that shapes SSA by differently affecting the response to the standard or deviant tones sounds only. More recently, we have also started to record from prefrontal cortex and observed that neurons show the highest degree of prediction error along the auditory hierarchy.Taken together our results unify three coexisting views of perceptual deviance detection at different levels of description: neuronal physiology, cognitive neuroscience and the theoretical predictive coding framework.Financial support was provided by the Spanish MINECO (Grant # SAF2016-75803-P), Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n (Grant # SA023P17) and the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie grant agreement No 722098\u201d to MSM.", "endtime": "12:30 PM", "event_id": "", "location": "Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building", "owner": "Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI)", "speaker": "Manuel Malmierca", "starttime": "11:30 AM", "summary": "", "title": "Emergence of deviance detection along the auditory neuroaxis and beyond: A neuronal correlate for predictive coding?", "url": "https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-manuel-malmierca", "date_dt": "14-02-2019"}

While data augmentation might alleviate the intrinsic lack of invariance it leads to networks of increased model complexity. We will show in this talk by showing that we can achieve equivariance to transformations by performing group convolution either by using canonical coordinates or by working in the spectral domain. Experiments validate our claim of lower complexity without sacrificing performance. When we want to infer 3D pose from 2D images, annotation is hardly possible and we have to rely on minimal supervision or geometry constraints. We show that building equivariant embeddings reduces 3D pose problems to a simple correlation operation avoiding, thus, supervised regression or spatial transformers.

A motivating premise of this work is that it does not always make sense to learn how to perform a task from scratch, end-to-end when certain basic motor skills should, in principle, be reusable. The core research questions we seek to address have to do with how human-like motor skills can be learned and represented, as well as what architectures support transfer and reusability in new settings.

{"date": "Tuesday, December 11, 2018 - 11:30am", "description": "Matthew SchaffDepartment of Neuroscience, UPennPairwise correlations in macaque auditory cortex predict multi-neuronal firing patternsOur understanding of the function of the auditory cortex derives almost exclusively from experiments that study the coding properties of single neurons. Although these studies have shed important information, they are limited because they have not considered how neuron-to-neuron (i.e., pairwise) correlations may affect population coding. We, therefore, sought to determine whether, in the primate auditory cortex, pairwise correlations contribute information to population coding above and beyond the information provided by the independent firing of auditory-cortex neurons. We recorded neuronal activity in the primary auditory cortex in a male rhesus monkey. Neuronal activity was recorded with multi-contact linear u-probe electrodes. While recording neuronal activity, the monkey passively listened to ripple stimuli. Based on either (1) the independent spiking activity of these neurons or (2) the independent spiking activity plus their pairwise correlations, we generated \u201cIsing\u201d models. Ising models are the maximum-entropy distributions that are consistent with experimentally observed firing rates and pairwise correlations without any mechanistic assumptions. We report that Ising models more accurately predict the experimental probability of population dynamics when pairwise correlations are taken into account along with independent spikes. This accuracy difference increases when predicting higher-order population dynamics. This study lays groundwork for future studies that determine the relative importance of correlations in processing different types of acoustic stimuli.", "endtime": "12:30 PM", "event_id": "", "location": "Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building", "owner": "Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "11:30 AM", "summary": "", "title": "Pairwise correlations in macaque auditory cortex predict multi-neuronal firing patterns", "url": "https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-5", "date_dt": "11-12-2018"}

{"date": "Monday, March 18, 2019 - 4:30pm", "description": "I extend the theory on factor models by incorporating \"local\" factors into the model. Local factors only affect an unknown subset of the observed variables. This implies a continuum of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, as is commonly observed in applications. I derive which factors are pervasive enough to be economically important and which factors are estimable using the common principal component estimator. I then introduce a new class of estimators to determine the number of those relevant factors. Unlike estimators that have been proposed in the past, my estimators are the first to use information in the eigenvectors as well as in the eigenvalues. I find strong evidence for the presence of local factors in a large panel of US macroeconomic indicators.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 20, 2019 - 4:00pm", "description": "This paper studies a labor market with directed search, where multi-worker firms follow a firm wage policy: They pay equally productive workers the same. The policy reduces wages, due to the influence of firms' existing workers on their wage setting problem, increasing the profitability of hiring. It also introduces a time-inconsistency into the dynamic firm problem, because firms face a less elastic labor supply in the short run. To consider outcomes when firms reoptimize each period, I study Markov perfect equilibria, proposing a tractable solution approach based on standard Euler equations. In two applications, I first show that firm wages dampen wage variation over the business cycle, amplifying that in unemployment, with quantitatively significant effects. Second, I show that firm wage firms may find it profitable to fix wages for a period of time, and that an equilibrium with fixed wages can be good for worker welfare, despite added volatility in the labor market.

{"date": "Thursday, March 21, 2019 - 3:30pm", "description": "Using unique survey and administrative data from the Canada Student Loans Program, we document that parental support and personal savings substantially lower student loan repayment problems. We develop a theoretical model for studying student borrowing and repayment in the presence of risky labor market outcomes, moral hazard, and costly earnings verification. This framework demonstrates that non-monetary costs of applying for income-based repayment assistance are critical to understanding why resources other than earnings lead to greater repayment. We further show that eliminating these non-monetary costs may be inefficient and lead to undesirable redistribution. Empirically, we demonstrate that expanding Canada's income-based Repayment Assistance Plan to automatically cover all borrowers would likely reduce program revenue by nearly one-half over early years of repayment. Finally, we show how student loan programs can be more efficiently designed to address heterogeneity in parental transfers in the presence of non-monetary earnings verification costs and moral hazard. * We thank Yifan Gong and Youngmin Park for advice on several theoretical results and Qian Liu for valuable research assistance.

While manuscript paintings and compositions mounted on wooden boards have been the subject of scholarly inquiry, an otherwise unknown type of hilye production involves the insertion of verbal icons into glass bottles. Today, three such \u201chilye bottles\u201d are held in the Topkap\u0131 Palace Library, where they remain unstudied and unpublished. This talk aims to present these newly uncovered artworks and explore their possible meanings and functions, among them their acting as a new kind of prophetic pharmacon during the late nineteenth century, at which time Muhammad was concretized and \u2018imbibed\u2019 as the ultimate elixir vitae.\nChristiane Gruber is Professor and Associate Chair in the History of Art Department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Her research interests span medieval Islamic art to contemporary visual culture. She has authored three books and has edited a dozen volumes on Islamic book arts, ascension texts and images, images of the Prophet Muhammad, and modern visual and material culture.

{"date": "March 5", "description": "Title: Martingale Difference Divergence and Its Applications to Contemporary Statistics\n Abstract: Martingale difference divergence (MDD) is a metric that quantifies the conditional mean dependence of a random vector Y given another random vector X. We shall present applications of martingale difference divergence and its variant to two contemporary statistical problems: high dimensional dependence testing and dimension reduction for multivariate time series. In the first part, we propose a novel test to assess the conditional mean dependence of a response variable on\u00a0 a large\u00a0 number\u00a0 of\u00a0 covariates. Our MDD-based procedure\u00a0 is able to detect certain type of departure from the null hypothesis of conditional mean independence without making any specific model assumptions. We establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed test statistic under suitable assumptions that can be verified for covariates with banded dependence or Gaussian distribution. Power analysis and a wild bootstrap procedure will also be presented along with some simulation results. In the second part, we introduce a new methodology to reduce the number of parameters in\u00a0 multivariate time series modeling. In particular, we seek a contemporaneous linear transformation such that the transformed time series has two parts with one part being conditionally mean independent of the past information. Our dimension reduction procedure is based on eigen-decomposition of\u00a0 the so-called cumulative martingale difference divergence matrix, which encodes the number and form of linear combinations that are conditionally mean independent of the past. We provide a simple way of estimating the number of factors and factor loading space, and obtain some theoretical results about the estimators. The finite sample performance will be illustrated from a real data analysis.", "endtime": " 4:30pm", "event_id": "", "location": "701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104", "owner": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)", "speaker": "", "starttime": "3:30pm ", "summary": "", "title": "Biostatistics Seminar Series - Xiaofeng Shao, PhD", "url": "http://events.med.upenn.edu/cceb/#!view/event/event_id/704035", "date_dt": "05-03-2019"}

{"date": "Thursday, January 17", "description": "Abstract: Memory systems are on the verge of a renaissance:  Scalable, persistent main memories (e.g., Intel\u2019s 3DXPoint) are the first new technology to enter the upper layers of the memory hierarchy in 50 years.  They bring a fundamentally new capability (i.e., persistence), a dramatic increase in capacity, and an array of complications (e.g., asymmetric read and write performance, power limitations, and wear out).  This combination of characteristics raises a deceptively simple but fundamental question:  What should we do with persistent main memory?  In this talk, I will describe several potential answers and the systems  my group has built to help understand how different answers affect performance, programmability, and other aspects of system design.   I\u2019ll also highlight the central challenges that these memories present and try to summarize what we have learned about them.

{"date": "Tuesday, January 29", "description": "Abstract: Correctness and security problems in modern computer systems can result from problematic hardware event orderings and interleavings during an application\u2019s execution. Since hardware designs are complex and since a single user-facing instruction can exhibit a variety of different hardware execution sequences, analyzing and verifying systems for correct event orderings is challenging.  My work addresses these challenges by combining hardware architecture and systems approaches with formal methods to support the specification, analysis, and verification of implementation-aware event ordering scenarios, with the specific goal of automatically synthesizing implementation-aware programs capable of violating correctness or security guarantees. In this talk, I will present two formal, early-stage verification tools and techniques rooted in this approach. TriCheck conducts axiomatic full-stack memory consistency model (MCM) verification (from high-level programming languages down through hardware implementations). Using rigorous and efficient formal approaches, TriCheck identified flaws in RISC-V\u2019s draft MCM specification and two counterexamples to a previously proven-correct compiler mapping scheme from C11 to IBM Power and ARMv7. Noting that MCM and security analysis are amenable to similar approaches, CheckMate uses related axiomatic techniques to evaluate susceptibility of a hardware design and its related system support to formally-specified classes of security exploits; in response, it synthesizes proof-of-concept exploit code when a design is susceptible. CheckMate automatically synthesized programs representative of Meltdown and Spectre attacks as well as new exploits, MeltdownPrime and SpectrePrime, that I have demonstrated on Intel hardware.\nBio: Caroline Trippel is a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at Princeton University. She is advised by Professor Margaret Martonosi on her computer architecture dissertation research, specifically on the topic of concurrency and security verification in heterogeneous parallel systems. Her work bridges computer architecture and formal methods and demonstrates the importance of that bridge in specifying and verifying the correct and secure execution of software running on such systems. Trippel has influenced the design of the RISC-V ISA memory consistency model (MCM) both via full-stack MCM analysis of its draft specification and her subsequent participation in the RISC-V Memory Model Task Group; she received recognition for this work via the 2017-2018 NVIDIA Graduate Research Fellowship. Additionally, Trippel has developed a novel methodology and tool that synthesized two new variants of the recently publicized Meltdown and Spectre attacks; this work lead to a funded collaboration with Intel on side-channel attack research. She received her B.S. in Computer Engineering from Purdue University in 2013 and her M.A. in Computer Science from Princeton University in 2015. She will receive her Ph.D. in Computer Science from Princeton University in Spring 2019.", "endtime": "4:00 PM", "event_id": "", "location": "", "owner": "CIS", "speaker": "", "starttime": "3:00 PM", "summary": "", "title": "Caroline Trippel Department of Computer Science Princeton University Title: \"Made to Order: Verifying Correctness and Security of Hardware through Event Orderings\"", "url": "http://www.cis.upenn.edu/about-cis/events/index.php", "date_dt": "29-01-2019"}

Her research focuses on the industrial organization of the medical care market: she studies the interactions between firms (particularly health insurers and providers such as hospitals); their effects on the price and quality of care provided; and the impact of market design and regulations on these outcomes. For example, a recent project (co-authored with Robin Lee) develops and estimates a framework to assess the impact of insurer competition on negotiated hospital prices, premiums charged to consumers, and welfare. This paper was published in Econometrica in 2017. A related paper, also co-authored with Robin Lee and published in the American Economic Review, uses a model of hospital network formation to investigate the impact of regulating the breadth of insurers\u2019 networks on hospital prices, premiums, and hence consumer surplus. A paper written with Fiona Scott Morton and Joe Hogan and published in the RAND Journal of Economics demonstrates that consumer inattention in the Medicare Part D market causes search frictions that prevent enrollees from switching away from relative high-priced plans. Reduced consumer inertia would both benefit consumers directly and remove a barrier to effective price competition between plans that would save both consumers and the government significant sums.\nProfessor Ho is a co-editor at the American Economic Journal: Economic Policy and has served on the editorial board of the American Economic Review, the American Economic Journal: Microeconomics and the Journal of Economic Literature.

{"date": "Apr 12 2019", "description": "As authoritarian governments around the world develop sophisticated technologies for controlling information, many observers have predicted that these controls would be ineffective because they are easily thwarted and evaded by savvy Internet users. In her book titled \"Censored: Distraction and Diversion Inside China's Great Firewall\", Margaret Roberts demonstrates that even censorship that is easy to circumvent can still be enormously effective. Taking advantage of digital data harvested from the Chinese Internet and leaks from China's Propaganda Department, this important book sheds light on how and when censorship influences the Chinese public.\nRoberts finds that much of censorship in China works not by making information impossible to access but by requiring those seeking information to spend extra time and money for access.\u00a0By inconveniencing users, censorship diverts the attention of citizens and powerfully shapes the spread of information.\u00a0When Internet users notice blatant censorship, they are willing to compensate for better access. But subtler censorship, such as burying search results or introducing distracting information on the web, is more effective because users are less aware of it. Roberts challenges the conventional wisdom that online censorship is undermined when it is incomplete and shows instead how censorship's porous nature is used strategically to divide the public.\nDrawing parallels between censorship in China and the way information is manipulated in the United States and other democracies, Roberts reveals how Internet users are susceptible to control even in the most open societies.\u00a0Demonstrating how censorship travels across countries and technologies,\u00a0Censored\u00a0gives an unprecedented view of how governments encroach on the media consumption of citizens.", "endtime": "1:00pm", "event_id": "", "location": "CSCC Conference Room, Perelman 418, 133 S. 36th St.", "owner": "Center for the Study of Contemporary China", "speaker": "Margaret Roberts,\u00a0Associate Professor of Political Science, University of California San Diego", "starttime": "12:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "Censored: Distraction and Diversion Inside China's Great Firewall", "url": "https://cscc.sas.upenn.edu//events/2019/04/12/censored-distraction-and-diversion-inside-chinas-great-firewall", "date_dt": "12-04-2019"}

Advances in biotechnology are occurring at an astonishing rate, with potential for solving problems in public health, medicine, conservation, and agriculture. But uncertainties remain about efficacy, ecological risks, unintended consequences, and ethical implications. This program investigates novel efforts to engage scientists, stakeholders, and communities to work together to explore these complex questions. The specific example discussed in this program involves gene-drive technology to change the genetics of wild mouse populations. Gene drives bias inheritance patterns beyond standard Mendelian rates (where offspring have a 50/50 chance of inheriting a gene from their mother or father). Synthetic gene drives have recently become possible through advanced gene-editing tools such as CRISPR, and they have been shown to work in the laboratory in yeast, fruit flies, and mosquitoes. Work on mice has begun in relation to two projects, one focused on conservation, the other on public health. Jason Delborne and Carrie Fyler will present the two sides of engagement between scientists and communities. Delborne will discuss a project that explores the possibility of using gene drives to eradicate an invasive mouse species from an island in order to protect endemic biodiversity. Fyler will examine a proposed project to engineer mice to prevent them from transmitting Lyme disease to ticks, using a gene drive on populations of mice on Martha\u2019s Vineyard.

Symbolic use of color always played a salient role in the sciences in research and teaching, but use of color in historical diagrams is a lacuna in history of science. To investigate this use, though, often means uncovering a whole cosmology otherwise not explicit in a diagram. The periodic table provides a salient and iconic example of nonmimetic color use in science. Famous depictions are Andreas von Antropoff\u2019s 1924 rectangular table of recurrent rainbow colors; Alcindo Flores Cabral\u2019s 1951 application of color in his round snail form using the red-green-blue (RGB) scheme; and Edward Mazurs\u2019s 1967 pine-tree system, in which he used warm and cold colors that he attributed to specific groups of elements\u2014an attribution that relates back to humoralism and alchemy. Beginning with the first periodic tables in the 19th century and continuing up to today, different researchers used different color regimes. Standardization plays an obvious role in chemistry and its diagrams, which makes the anarchy in color use in these diagrams all the more impressive. This talk focuses on periodic tables in chemical journals and textbooks, and explores and compares the development of different color codes from John Newlands and Dmitri Mendeleev in the 1860s on to the 1960s.

Beginning with its emergence in the Progressive era, saccharin has been a controversial sweetener in the United States. Unlike many of the controversial additives of the early 20th century, such as the preservatives benzoate of soda and borax, debates around saccharin reemerged in the postwar era, culminating in its dramatic ban in 1977. Across this 80-year span a central tension in saccharin\u2019s identity persisted. Although often used as a sugar substitute by households and food manufacturers to cut costs, it also had significant medical applications in the dietetic treatment of diabetes and obesity. In the postwar era, as ideas about the connection between body weight and health transformed American cultures of dieting, this tension took new form. Focusing on the debates of the 1970s, this talk will explore how saccharin crossed the line between food and drug and the significant implications this held for the federal government\u2019s authority to regulate its use. Ultimately, this case lets us explore the shaping of the cultural authority of science and the regulatory powers of the state when faced with demands for consumer choice.

While historians of science emphasize scientists in Europe, such as Marie Curie and Alexander von Humboldt, scientists in Latin America rarely receive a mention.

{"date": "Thursday, March 21, 2019 - 4:30pm", "description": "Natsume S\u014dseki, perhaps the most renowned writer of early-twentieth century Japan, stated that his aim in writing the novel Kusamakura (1906) had been purely aesthetic: \u201cI would be satisfied if a kind of feeling\u2014a feeling of beauty\u2014remains in the mind of the reader.\u201d The novel, full of references to iconic works of visual art and composed largely of poetic vignettes with little in the way of dramatic development, has since been hailed as a radical experiment in modernist writing.

{"date": "Thursday, April 4, 2019 - 4:30pm", "description": "The study of historical thought and history-writing in Song China has flourished in recent years, but some areas remain inadequately understood. One of these has to do with the treatment of the early medieval Northern Dynasties in Southern Song historiography. Past studies have assumed that geopolitical circumstances (that is, the Jurchen Jin occupation of north China) led Southern Song historians and philosophers to reject, on ethnic grounds, any possibility of the \u201cbarbarian\u201d Northern Dynasties being legitimate. The idea that foreign conquerors could gain legitimacy by \u201cSinicizing\u201d themselves culturally was, according to such reasoning, only acceptable or appealing in the Jurchen-ruled north. This talk will show that the story was significantly more complex. By analyzing early thirteenth-century historical works by Zhu Fu (1140-1215), Ye Shi (1150-1223), and Nangong Jingyi (fl. 1236), I will argue that the discourse of \u201cSinicization\u201d first became an important aspect of Chinese historical interpretation in the Southern Song, and that it originated not as a challenge to the supremacist ideology of Chinese superiority but as a way to reconcile that ideology with a problematic historical reality. I will also explore the question of whether the rise of the Mongols had any impact on this discourse.\nProfessor Shao-yun Yang received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley and teaches East Asian history at Denison University. A second-generation descendant of Chinese immigrants to Singapore, he has published several articles on the intellectual history of Chinese ethnic identity and Chinese attitudes toward ethnocultural others during the medieval period.

In her book titled \"Censored: Distraction and Diversion Inside China's Great Firewall\", Margaret Roberts demonstrates that even censorship that is easy to circumvent can still be enormously effective. Taking advantage of digital data harvested from the Chinese Internet and leaks from China's Propaganda Department, this important book sheds light on how and when censorship influences the Chinese public.Roberts finds that much of censorship in China works not by making information impossible to access but by requiring those seeking information to spend extra time and money for access.\u00a0By inconveniencing users, censorship diverts the attention of citizens and powerfully shapes the spread of information.\u00a0When Internet users notice blatant censorship, they are willing to compensate for better access. But subtler censorship, such as burying search results or introducing distracting information on the web, is more effective because users are less aware of it. Roberts challenges the conventional wisdom that online censorship is undermined when it is incomplete and shows instead how censorship's porous nature is used strategically to divide the public.Drawing parallels between censorship in China and the way information is manipulated in the United States and other democracies, Roberts reveals how Internet users are susceptible to control even in the most open societies.\u00a0Demonstrating how censorship travels across countries and technologies,\u00a0Censored\u00a0gives an unprecedented view of how governments encroach on the media consumption of citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain navigation\n\n", "endtime": "", "event_id": "", "location": "", "owner": "Center for East Asian Studies", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "CSCC Speaker Series: Margaret Roberts- \"Censored: Distraction and Diversion Inside China's Great Firewall\"", "url": "https://ceas.sas.upenn.edu/events/cscc-speaker-series-margaret-roberts-censored-distraction-and-diversion-inside-chinas-great", "date_dt": "12-04-2019"}

He is the author of The Brotherhood In Saffron: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh And Hindu Revivalism (Westview Special Studies on South and Southeast Asia, 1987), which was selected by the Tata Literature Live awards committee as the best non-fiction book published on an Indian topic in 2018; and is co-author (along with Shridhar D. Damle) of RSS: A View to the Inside (Viking Press, forthcoming). He was a teaching intern at the University of Chicago, on the Political Science faculty at the College of Wooster (where he administered a junior year abroad program for the Great Lakes Colleges Association) and also taught at the University of Georgia. Professor Andersen worked as a staff member for a Democrat member of Congress from Ohio before joining the US State Department. He served overseas in South Asia, including as special assistant to the US Ambassador to India, William Clarke, as well as in Washington, D.C. where he retired in 2004 as head of the Office of Research for South Asia. He subsequently joined the faculty at SAIS where he became Administrative Director of its South Asian Studies Program. Since 2010, Professor Andersen has also taught graduate International Relations seminars at Tongji University in Shanghai. He has written extensively on religious politics and is currently doing preliminary research on a book that will analyze the intersection of law and religion in India. He will retire from SAIS at the conclusion of Spring 2019 semester.About the Lecture:The Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS) and its 100 affiliated organizations over the past twenty-five years have come to assert significant influence in India. These affiliates have penetrated virtually all areas of Indian society in fields as varied as labor, politics, the press, education, and the Hindu ecclesiastical establishment. Its political affiliate, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is India\u2019s ruling party, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a former full-time RSS worker. Professor Andersen's forthcoming book on the subject, The RSS: A View to the Inside, is something of a sequel to his earlier book, The Brotherhood in Saffron. In this lecture, Professor Andersen will address three basic questions about the RSS that are analyzed in nine case studies in the new book: 1) Why has the RSS and its affiliates expanded so rapidly over the past twenty-five years? 2) How have these organizations evolved to reflect their much more diverse membership? 3) What factors drove the RSS\u2019 increased political involvement and how does the RSS\u2019 evolution impact the country\u2019s politics and policy, including the prospects for secularism and democracy?[Event Flyer]", "endtime": "", "event_id": "", "location": "", "owner": "Center for the Advanced Study of India", "speaker": "", "starttime": "", "summary": "", "title": "The RSS: Evolution of India\u2019s Leading Hindu Nationalist Organization", "url": "https://casi.ssc.upenn.edu/events/walterandersen", "date_dt": "18-03-2019"}

He is currently also on the Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), and National Commodities and Derivates Exchange (NCDEX). He was Chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), Government of India (2011-14), and Director (Markets, Trade, and Institutions, and later in Asia) at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) for more than 10 years (2001-11). He worked as a Chair Professor NABARD at the Institute of Economic Growth (1998-2000), and prior to that he was Director/Chief Economist, Agriculture and Rural Development at National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) from 1991-97. Dr. Gulati has been deeply involved in policy analysis and advice in India. He was the youngest member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister of India (Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee); Member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, and Member of the State Planning Board of Karnataka.

With India\u2019s GDP growth of averaging 7 to 8 percent over the last 15 years likely to continue for at least a decade more, the country\u2019s agricultural sector will be under increasing pressure to meet the then nation\u2019s food, feed, and fiber needs. Additionally, by 2030, India will have about 600 million people living in urban areas, and will face major logistical challenges to move food from hinterlands to urban areas.With limited land and depleting water tables, can India produce enough food for her population or will it become a huge importer of food? What agricultural policies has India been following over the last few decades and what have been their impact, especially on poverty, malnutrition, and farmers\u2019 incomes?This lecture will discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead for Indian agriculture and examine how agricultural policies have hindered the changes needed in the sector. A tectonic shift in food and agricultural policies is overdue if India is to remain a competitive producer of agricultural goods, improve the livelihood of Indian farmers whose average holding size is just 1.1 ha, and prepare for the impacts of climate change.[Event Flyer]", "endtime": "", "event_id": "", "location": "", "owner": "Center for the Advanced Study of India", "speaker": "", "starttime": "", "summary": "", "title": "Who Will Feed India?

Her first book, Pipe Politics, Contested Waters: Embedded Infrastructures of Millennial Mumbai (Duke University Press, 2015), was awarded the American Institute of Indian Studies Joseph W. Elder Prize in the Indian Social Sciences. She is currently working on a book-length study of theatricality in Mumbai\u2019s political life.\u00a0About the Lecture:This lecture will discuss cash-compensated crowds that assembe for political gatherings\u2014protest marches, road blocks, campaign rallies\u2014in the Indian city of Mumbai. Popular and scholarly discourse tends to dismiss paid crowds as inauthentic, even fraudulent forms of political assembly. This research instead explores cash-compensated crowds as instances of political utterance and representation, probing the dueling moral registers by means of which the theatrical character of political life in Mumbai is evaluated: as either political theatre or political deceit. On some occasions, cash-compensated mass assembly are characterized as \u201cmeaningless\u201d and as \u201conly natak\u201d (drama, theatre)\u2014suggesting a normative understanding of what a \u201cmeaningful\u201d political rally shouldbe. But in other contexts, we see that it is precisely its very theatrical quality that renders a rally compelling or convincing at all. Professor Bj\u00f6rkman's talk will outline when\u2014in what contexts\u2014natak is evaluated as a compelling idiom of political utterance, communication, and representation, and when political theatre is described as \"only natak\"\u2014a disdainful dismissal that suggests something is only theatrical when it ought not to be\u2014or indeed is pretending not to be. Taking theatricality and performance seriously as an idiom of political speech and representation, the accounts suggest, may offer one way out of the impasses of post-truth political present where political communication tends to be either evaluated for its truth value or else dismissed as lies. Attending to explicitly theatrical dimensions of political life calls attention to a richer array of ideas and moral-evaluative frameworks.[Event Flyer]", "endtime": "", "event_id": "", "location": "", "owner": "Center for the Advanced Study of India", "speaker": "", "starttime": "", "summary": "", "title": "Natak: Political Theatre and Political Deceit in Mumbai", "url": "https://casi.ssc.upenn.edu/events/bjorkman", "date_dt": "23-04-2019"}

{"date": "November 5, 2018", "description": "Professor Hirota\u2019s current book project, \u201cThe Business of the Nation: Foreign Contract Labor and the Rise of American Immigration Control,\u201d examines the transnational business of importing Asian, Canadian, European, and Mexican contract laborers to the United States and the evolution of federal alien contract labor law designed to restrict this form of immigration over the course of the long nineteenth century. Since the early nineteenth century, Americans opposed the immigration of poor foreign workers who would degrade the dignity of labor and lower American wage standards. The opposition to immigrant labor became especially strong in the case of contract workers. In 1885, American workers\u2019 antipathy to \u201calien contract labor\u201d resulted in the passage of the federal Foran Act to ban the landing of foreign contract workers and deport those already in the United States back to their countries of origin. This project examines how hostility toward contract labor migration influenced American immigration law and how the alien contract labor law in turn affected immigrant workers.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  The paper traces the intellectual and legal genealogy of alien contract labor law by surveying the antebellum roots of opposition to imported labor in the United States. While labor radicalism in the late nineteenth century played a crucial role in the introduction of the Foran Act, the federal law was built upon earlier discourses on servile labor and the economic impact on Americans of immigration of certain kinds. In particular, the paper identifies the following four issues in antebellum America as the ideological and legal origins of the alien contract labor law: 1) Free Soilism, 2) \u201cpauper labor\u201d discourse, 3) assisted emigration, and 4) coolieism. The analysis in this paper is not intended to provide new evidence or revise historiography on these topics. Instead, the paper aims to demonstrate how the antebellum debates over the four issues collectively, if not exclusively, laid the foundations for the federal alien contract labor law, placing it in the broader framework of immigration politics beyond the labor conflict in the late nineteenth century.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Hidetaka Hirota is a non-tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Institute for Advanced Study at Waseda University in Japan.

{"date": "November 27, 2017", "description": "Between 1967 and 1979, the United States\u2019 divorce rate doubled. The rapidly rising divorce rate created a widespread crisis among women who had relied on their husbands for economic support and access to social insurance benefits such as Social Security and health insurance. In reponse, a now-forgotten strand of the 1970s feminist movement, which I call \u201cthe feminist divorce reform movement,\u201d emerged and organized itself around securing women\u2019s place in the United States\u2019 marriage-based insurance system. This paper, part of a larger project on this movement, examines divorce\u2019s decreasing political salience as more and more women entered the permanent workforce. In the 1970s, one-third of married American women were in the paid labor force. By 1985 that number had shot up. Even women with young children were now as likely to be found in the workforce as at home: around 50 percent of mothers with children under three and roughly 70 percent of mothers with children over six were in the labor force. In response, feminists who had once focused on shoring up the marriage-based insurance system turned their efforts toward securing women\u2019s place in the employment-based insurance system. In this paper I consider how legislative battles over the Family and Medical Leave Act, universal child care, and welfare reform fit into a longer history of feminist activism dedicated to creating a social insurance system that protected women from the economic vulnerabilities created by their carework obligations.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Suzanne Kahn received her Ph.D. in American History from Columbia University in 2015.

More specifically, the paper highlights the possible impact of the period of papal interdict (c. 1208 \u2013 1214), imposed by Pope Innocent III in response to King John\u2019s intransigence over the appointment of a new archbishop of Canterbury, during this transitional period in criminal procedure. It argues that the interdict, with its suspension of liturgies, might have forced experimentation with alternative means of reaching verdicts in felony cases. The paper also suggests that juries might have been involved in the issuance of ordeal verdicts in the late ordeal period in England, in which case the shift from trial by ordeal to trial by jury may be less a moment of rupture than a transition from one form of trial using juries to another, albeit a trial form more starkly desacralized after 1215. It is the author\u2019s hope that the paper will serve as a starting point for further research, not a decisive answer to the questions it raises, including whether England\u2019s rapid adoption of final jury verdicts may owe something to the tussle between King John and a particularly imperial and imperious pope.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Elizabeth Papp Kamali is an Assistant Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, where she teaches Criminal Law, English Legal History, Medieval English Law, and a seminar on Mind and Criminal Responsibility.\u00a0 She is a faculty member of Harvard\u2019s Standing Committee on Medieval Studies.\u00a0 Her research focuses on the medieval English common law and the history of criminal law, with a particular interest in the early criminal trial jury.\u00a0 Her current projects include studies of the role of criminal intent in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century English felony cases, medieval understandings of anger\u2019s operation in felony adjudication, conflict between urban customary law and the English common law in the early fourteenth century, and the influence of Roman law on the early development of the common law.\u00a0 Recent publications include \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Daughter of Hell Fire: Anger\u2019s Role in Medieval English Felony Cases\u201d (Law and History Review, 2017) and \u201cLaw and Equity in a Medieval English Manor Court\u201d (in Texts and Contexts in Legal History: Essays in Honor of Charles Donahue, 2016).", "endtime": "1:15 PM", "event_id": "55474", "location": "Faculty Lounge", "owner": "Penn Law School", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00 PM", "summary": "Workshop open to faculty and invited guests", "title": "Legal History Consortium Workshop: Elizabeth Kamali", "url": "https://www.law.upenn.edu/newsevents/calendar.php#event_id/55474/view/event", "date_dt": "11-10-2017"}

The vast journey of blue moves from Hebrew ritual uses of snail pigments to the chemistry and economics of blue jean dyes.\nAmerican chemist Roald Hoffmann is widely known for using quantum mechanics to help reveal the mechanisms of chemical reactions. He was born Roald Safran in 1937 in a small Polish town that is now part of the Ukraine. Hoffmann's father was a civil engineer familiar with the local infrastructure, which made him of value to the Nazis. For a while the family was allowed to remain in its own home, but was later relocated to a labor camp, where many of the Nazi guards could be bribed. After being paid off, the guards allowed 5-year-old Roald, his mother, two aunts, and an uncle to escape in early 1943. A Ukrainian couple hid them in the attic and storeroom of a nearby schoolhouse where the husband taught. Hoffmann's father remained behind in the camp, where he was tortured and killed by the Nazis in June 1943 for his involvement in a plot to arm camp prisoners.After the war ended, Hoffmann and his mother relocated to New York, where he later won a Westinghouse science scholarship to Columbia University, earning his BA there. He took his doctorate in chemistry from Harvard and in 1965 began teaching chemistry at Cornell, where he is now Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters Emeritus. Since 2002, Hoffmann has hosted a monthly cabaret called \"Entertaining Science\" at Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9 in Greenwich Village.In 1963 Hoffmann introduced the extended H\u00fcckel method, a molecular orbital theory that allows calculation of the electronic structure of molecules. In 1965, in collaboration with Nobel laureate Robert Burns Woodward, he introduced the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a method for exploring the electronic structure of transition states and intermediates in organic reactions. Hoffmann and Japanese chemist Kenichi Fukui shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1981 for their theories, developed independently, concerning the course of chemical reactions (Woodward had died two years earlier and thus was ineligible).Hoffmann is also a published poet, playwright, and essayist. His poems appear in several collections: The Metamict State (1987), Gaps and Verges (1990), Memory Effects (1999), and Soliton (2002). In addition, he is a philosopher of science who has made significant contributions to our conceptual, historical, and normative understanding of chemistry. Many of his philosophical essays have been collected in Roald Hoffman on the Philosophy, Art, and Science of Chemistry by Jeffrey Kovac and Michael Weisberg, eds. (2012).", "endtime": "6:30pm", "event_id": "", "location": "Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "5:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "The Allure of Indigo", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/allure-indigo", "date_dt": "22-10-2014"}

Through film, photography and performance, the artists in this exhibition explore the contours of belonging across different contexts - from the invention of nationalist social rituals to the homecoming of veterans, from the trope of the \"haunted\" house to that of the family portrait. By bringing together the work of an international group of artists approaching home as a volatile concept, this exhibition examines how fantasies of belonging involve complex psychic and affective responses to specific material and historical conditions informed by race, gender, sexuality and class.\"Itinerant Belongings\" grounds this inquiry by revisiting critical debates that bridged activism and art in the 1980s and 1990s. Responding to the presence of the homeless, the displaced, and the disenfranchised in American cities, two of the artists in the exhibition, William Pope.L and Krzysztof Wodiczko, produced projects in this critical moment that questioned the very notion of what it meant for a space to be \"public.\" This exhibition aims to reanimate this dialogue and extend it to a contemporary global landscape marked by mass displacement, armed conflict, and debates around borders and immigration.Work by Yael Bartana, Jamie Diamond, Andrew Moore, William Pope.L, Paul Salveson, Jessica Vaughn, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, and Krzysztof Wodiczko will be on display at Slought and the Addams Gallery at PennDesign, and viewers are encouraged to take an itinerant path from one exhibition site to another.\nMore information", "endtime": "", "event_id": "", "location": "Slought, 4017 Walnut Street, PhiladelphiaAddams Fine Arts Hall, 200 S. 36th Street, Philadelphia", "owner": "Wolf Humanities Center Events", "speaker": "", "starttime": "", "summary": "", "title": "Itinerant Belongings", "url": "http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/itinerant-belongings", "date_dt": "01-11-2014"}

How do their patterns provide protective camouflage in tropical rain forests? How is nanotechnology using the waterproofing properties of butterfly colors to fabricate energy-efficient materials for buildings? In this panel discussion, Penn researchers discuss how their scientific and technological work imitates nature.\nUsing holographic lithography, Shu Yang and her Penn research team recently developed a material that mimics the iridescent and water-resistant qualities of butterfly wings. Applying this innovation, they developed a superhydrophobic coating that can be sprayed onto any surface. The solution contains nanoscopic particles that add a nearly invisible layer of roughness to a surface. Among other things, this highly water resistant coating is now being used on solar panels to keep them drier, cleaner and more efficient.\nIn 2004, Shu Yang was named one of the World's Top 100 Innovators Under 35 by MIT Technology Review. In 2006, she received the prestigious Faculty Early Career Development Award from the National Science Foundation. And in 2011, she was selected by the National Academy of Engineering to present at the Japan-America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium.

Muralists Betsy Casa\u00f1as and Ernel Martinez join Mural Arts Program founder and director Jane Golden in this conversation on culture, community building, and arts education. Moderated by Penn urban design professor Amy Hillier, the event will feature site-specific mural projects from around the city.Jane Golden, as the driving force behind the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program, is a true agent of social change, a Philadelphia phenom. Conceived as an anti-graffiti program in 1984, the Mural Arts Program has under Golden's leadership produced over 3600 landmark works of public art in nearly every neighborhood throughout the city. What do these murals embody? So much\u2014about what transforms places, people, communities, and institutions. Read the program's mission statement: \"We believe art ignites change.\" Live its golden rule: \"When we create art with each other and for each other, the force of life can triumph.\" And celebrate its \"Palette of Core Values.\" Do these things, and you will know why Jane Golden has been honored with so many awards, among them the Philadelphia Award, the Hepburn Medal, the 2012 Governor's Award for Innovation in the Arts, and the Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania Award.Betsy Casa\u00f1as is a studio and public mural artist, a community activist, and an educator who was born and raised in the heart of \"The Badlands\" of North Philadelphia's barrio. She received her BFA from Moore College of Art and Design, and has worked in the Latino community since 1994. Casa\u00f1as has exhibited her work in various solo and group exhibits and has designed over 40 public murals and mosaics nationally and internationally. In 2007 she cofounded The Semilla Arts, a grassroots initiative that uses collaborative art as a means of empowering people and communities in underserved areas. In 2010 she opened \"A Seed of Diamond Gallery,\" a community space where artists of different cultural background gather to tell their stories through spoken word, music, and visual arts.Ernel Martinez was inspired to become a mural artist while a PennDesign student in Jane Golden's class on public art at the University of Pennsylvania, where one of his mentors was Terry Adkins. Martinez received his MFA from Penn in 2004 and has since worked on over 25 murals across Philadelphia, including A Place to Call Home, The Color of Your Voice.Amy Hillier holds joint faculty appointments in Penn's School of Design and School of Social Policy and Practice, where she teaches and studies the impact of the built environment on public health and welfare\u2014in particular, the impact to disadvantaged communities of more limited access to services and resources.

Value with respect to color can mean the relative lightness or darkness of a hue, but can also mean aesthetic merit, political importance, moral acceptability, or material worth. The question of color's values is also fundamentally a question of sensory perception, constructed at the level of the individual synapse as well as the cultural collective. We want to consider the descriptive language of color\u2014how we evoke color with and/or through value-laden words or actions, how we assign qualities or quantities to different colors, how color is experienced through taste or touch as well as sight.Four distinguished scholars - Richard Doyle, Torkwase Dyson, Nicole Fleetwood, and Mohan Matthen - will explore the values of color from a variety of perspectives. How and why do we classify and assign values (moral, economic, social, epistemic) to particular colors, even 'people of color,' or material gradations, from light to dark? How does color function in a modern economy? What is its role in making subjectivity legible through its performance? How does color function as nonverbal communication that is affectively felt? To what degree is color a 'natural' or physical property and in what ways is it a rhetorical or cultural construction? And, how do institutions assign value to color?\u00a0\nSCHEDULE10:00-10:15am | WelcomeElizabeth Della Zazzera, Graduate Humanities Forum ChairNese Devenot, GHF Mellon Fellow\n10:15am-12:30pm | Panel DiscussionModerators: Jeannie Kenmotsu and Ting Fung Ho, GHF Mellon FellowsCommentators: Louise Daoust and Alan Niles, GHF Mellon Fellows\nRichard Doyle\nBy the Way, Which One's Pink?: On the Minimal Conditions for a Transmission of Philip K.

But we live these short life spans. Why not do the thing that's the coolest thing in the world to do? \u2014David Eagleman, The New Yorker\n\nDavid Eagleman is best known for his work on time perception, synesthesia, and neurolaw. He directs the Laboratory for Perception and Action at the Baylor College of Medicine, whose goal is to understand how the brain constructs perception, how different brains do so differently, and how this matters for society. He also founded and directs Baylor's Initiative on Neuroscience and Law, which studies how new discoveries in neuroscience should navigate the way we make laws, punish criminals, and develop rehabilitation. And, he founded and is chief scientific officer for BrainCheck, a company that uses interactive testing on portable tablets to measure brain function, which schools are using to rapidly measure concussions at the sidelines.\nIn 2011, Eagleman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and that same year won the Eric Hoffer Book Award Montaigne Medal for his book Wednesday is Indigo Blue: Discovering the Brain of Synesthesia, coauthored with Richard Cytowic. In 2012 he was named Science Educator of the Year by the Society for Neuroscience, and was featured as one of the year's Brightest Idea Guys by Italy's Style Magazine. In 2014, he received the John J. McGovern Award for Excellence in Biomedical Education from the American Medical Writers' Association.\nOne of his latest books, Livewired: How the Brain Rewrites its Own Circuitry, is due in spring 2015 (Doubleday Canada).

I examine the circuitry connecting Baloch communities in the contemporary Gulf metropolis with Balochistan, looking to musical and ritual to trace key routes. I situate citizen and migrant Baloch populations alongside the kafala (imported labor) economy of the Gulf, noting a parallel kafala among Baloch, where Baloch of means in the Gulf sponsor residencies for Baloch of lower socioeconomic stature, including musicians\u2014modern and traditional. The distinction between modern and traditional Baloch music can be set against projects for representing the past and cultural heritage strategically undertaken by Arab Gulf rulerships, in both cases with historical spheres of mobility and cross-cultural encounter at the heart of narratives of tradition and heritage. While notions of Baloch culture, identity, and tradition are in some senses inseparable from the struggle for territorial sovereignty in Balochistan, local Gulf Baloch populations\u2014particularly in Muscat\u2014offer another perspective on the cognitive mapping of Baloch cultural performance, evolving local idioms often in dialogue with global popular culture flows and with other populations with an established presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean regions.\n\nGeorge Murer is a PhD candidate at the Graduate Center, City University of New York. His areas of concentration are music in Iran and Central Asia, Kurdistan, and the Indian Ocean world. His dissertation focuses on Baloch musical repertoires as cultivated and patronized in the Eastern Arabian Peninsula.

Largely from the lower-stature artisan class in Punjab, they were able to enjoy a higher status in the British class system that placed South Asians above the local Africans, and build on their labor skills to make rapid economic progress. Their love of their sacred sounds, and the freedom to practice their religion, enabled them to congregate around sonic worship and forge a strong community. When colonial East Africa obtained independence in the mid-twentieth century, many Sikh families, concerned with their lot within emergent African nationalism in the newly formed nation states, migrated to the UK and the USA. For these twice migrant Sikhs, Kenya, rather than India, became the new home; and the original place of congregation at the rail depot, Makindu, now a famous Sikh temple in Kenya, became a site for sacred travel, replete with special meanings. In this paper, I ethnographically investigate the making of this new home and new pilgrimage site.\u00a0 Engaging in in-depth conversations with \u201cAfrican Sikhs\u201d in Kenya, the UK, and the USA, supplemented by internet fieldwork, and drawing on scholarly literature on home, pilgrimage, diaspora, mobility, sound, and affect, I focus on the role of sacred sound as affective connective tissue in diasporic networks, and explore the Indian Ocean as a dynamic sphere of affective flows and potentialities in meaning making and belonging.\n\nInderjit N. Kaur is an ethnomusicologist at the University of Michigan, specializing in South Asian musical cultures. Her research interests include affect, senses, phenomenology, and transnationalism. Kaur has published in journals such as the Yearbook of Traditional Music and has articles forthcoming in MusiCultures and Civilisations, and a chapter in the Oxford Handbook of Phenomenological Ethnomusicology.

Focusing on Sheedi and Siddi festivals such as the Sheedi Mela and festival for Bava Gor, along with musical instruments like the Malunga and musical traditions like Dhol, these will serve as examples of how dance and musical traditions reflect histories of maritime movement and can be used to contribute to improved understandings of South Asian identities.\n\nBrian Jackson is a Ph.D. Student and Fontaine Fellow in Africana Studies at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nCOFFEE BREAK (3:45-4:15 PM)\nGROUP DISCUSSION OF THE PROJECT (4:15-5:00 PM)\n\n\n\nEllen Hebden, University of Wisconsin, Madison (10:00-10:45 AM)\n\u201cSwahili Covers, Sufi Prayers, and Liberation Hymns: Women\u2019s Mobilities in Competitive Tufo Dance Associations in Northern Mozambique\u201d\nTufo is a genre of music and dance in Mozambique born out of movements and migrations across the Indian Ocean and along the Swahili Coast. In this paper, I examine tufo as a rapidly expanding genre among women to emphasize its growing popularity as a mode of female mobility\u2014as members of dance societies, women travel for performances, gain community visibility, and become socially and politically mobile. Oral histories suggest that a Tanzanian trader first introduced tufo on Mozambique Island in the early 1930s, when it was a male-only dance. In the Mozambican context several changes occurred: women took over the genre, and it spread inland and further down the coast. After independence in 1975, tufo was secularized and politicized, and today, given its expansive repertoire, it is performed at any number of occasions: Islamic ceremonies, weddings, initiation celebrations, birthdays, political events, and commemorative days. While the socio-spatial movements of men have often been the focus of mobility scholarship in the Indian Ocean area, tufo reveals the ways in which women are also important figures of mobility as artists. Drawing on 14 months of ethnographic research as a member of a tufo group in coastal Pebane, Mozambique, I analyze the performance repertoire of the group Estrela Vermelha de Pebane, to show how women strategically use the particulars of sound, lyrics, rhythm, and choreography in tufo performances to pursue new forms of access to critical socio-political networks and spatial movements.\n\nEllen Hebden is a doctoral candidate in cultural anthropology and ethnomusicology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with an MMus in ethnomusicology from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies.

Her dissertation project is an ethnographic study of rural women\u2019s mobilities in Mozambique through the lens of an expansive network of women\u2019s competitive dance societies that perform a popular genre of music and dance called tufo.\n\nAndrew J. Eisenberg, New York University, Abu Dhabi (10:45 AM - 12:00 PM)\n\u201cMusical Self-Fashioning in Mombasa: The Life and Career of Ustadh Zein L\u2019Abdin Ahmed Alamoody (1932-2016)\u201d\nScholars have often glossed Swahili taarab as an \u201cIndian Ocean\u201d music genre that incorporates Arab, Indian, and African as well as Latin American and other broadly Western elements. While broadly correct, this characterization, in the words of Swahili writer and scholar Said A. Khamis, \u201cdoes not adequately capture the ambiguities and complexities of [taarab\u2019s] protean nature\u201d (Khamis 2001, 145). Rather than being this much Arab, this much Indian, and so on, Swahili taarab is more accurately described as being marked by multiple, discrete processes of transcultural borrowing and translation. The unfinalized, experimental character of taarab\u2019s hybridity situates the genre as a space in which Swahili subjects engage creatively with ideas of what it means to be Swahili. Extending my previous work on the \u201cIndian\u201d sub-genre of Swahili taarab (Eisenberg, 2017), this chapter explores what I call musical self-fashioning in the life and career of the late Swahili taarab composer, poet, singer, and oudist Ustadh Zein L\u2019Abdin Ahmed Alamoody (1932-2016), creator of Mombasa\u2019s \u201cArabic\u201d taarab style. Drawing on theoretical discussions of self-formation in the works of Bakhtin, Vygotsky, Bourdieu, and Foucault, I describe musical self-fashioning as practices that conflate the development of a personal style in music with the development of a personal understanding of self. It is just these sorts of practices, I argue, that underlay Zein L\u2019Abdin\u2019s engagements with Egyptian, Indian, Kuwaiti, Yemeni, and coastal East African musics over the course of his career.\n\nAndrew J.

What do we make of this term? It sets on edge the teeth of scholars of India\u2014as the wide gap between forms of Buddhism and Hinduism seems to expose a decidedly unscholarly laziness and disinterest in looking beyond the boundaries of Southeast Asia. So, too, for scholars of the Islamicate world, who may note that a linkage of India with Hindu-Buddhism downplays the trajectories of Islam, which also arrived via the subcontinent. Finally, a scholarly fixation on earlier forms of Indic religion altogether ignores the contemporary practices of Tamil Hindus or Chinese Buddhists. This paper considers the scholarly roots of this term in colonial scholarship, and within ethnomusicology, and attempts to tally the benefits of continued use of this easy shorthand against the costs of what it has inadvertently written out.\n\nJulia Byl is Assistant Professor in ethnomusicology at the University of Alberta, where she moved in 2015 after three years as a post-doctoral fellow at King's College London. Her book, Antiphonal Histories: Resonant Pasts in the Toba Batak Musical Present was published in 2014 by Wesleyan University Press. Her research centers on the intersection between ethnography, historiography, and the archive. She pursues these issues in two spheres: in manuscript and archival work on music and power in Indian Ocean musical cultures, and in \u201cCivic Modulations,\u201d a research project in Dili, East Timor, on public music, the individual, and the transnational institution.\n\nJim Sykes, University of Pennsylvania (2:00-2:45 PM)\n\u201cIndian and Chinese Musical Relations in Singapore: The Sonic Politics of Sameness/Difference.\u201d\nIndia and China may be in a geopolitical battle for control of the Indian Ocean Region, but in Singapore, Indians and Chinese live and sometimes make music together. In this talk, I consider how the imagined history of cultural and religious connections across the Silk Road emerges in twenty-first century Singapore to animate Indian-Chinese musical relationships borne both of colonial histories of Indian Ocean migrant labor and postcolonial migrations due to the lure of twenty-first century global capital. I explore the presence of Chinese Taoist worshippers at Thaipusam (the largest annual Hindu celebration on the island) and the performance of Tamil Hindu drum ensembles (urumi melam) at Chinese Taoist festivals. Demonstrating how development projects tore down \u201corganically multicultural\u201d neighborhoods starting in the late 1970s, I argue that Singaporean state-driven discourses on multiculturalism presume a longue dur\u00e9e cultural separateness between Indians and Chinese that is only now being broached through state cultural interventions.\n\nJim Sykes is an Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

Coomaraswamy, both of which became major influences on the composer\u2019s later work. Significantly more complex than his other works for prepared piano, Sonatas and Interludes is generally recognized as one of Cage\u2019s most important compositions.

The LNCC which has received media coverage for building South America\u2019s largest supercomputer, \u201cSantos Dumont\u201d, and for its high-profile international projects such as \u201cPampa Azul\u201d which focuses on genetic mapping of the Zika genome. Recently, however, the LNCC has faced a highly publicized budget cutback due to the 2014 Lava Jato scandal and subsequent state fallout, necessitating that the laboratory place a significant number of its projects on \u201cstand by\u201d. The budget cutback has Brazilian scientists and experts fearing larger fiscal and technical consequences for the laboratory, which has led them to explore alternative measures to keep their projects and facilities afloat. Utilizing archival and ethnographic methods, this presentation examines the complicated business of scientific innovation in Brazil in crisis mode.\u00a0\nBy analyzing the LNCC\u2019s growing prominence in the emerging field of bioinformatics, this paper shows how local experts attempt to \u2018make do\u2019 with and by-pass such constraints to produce knowledge on their own terms. The laboratory\u2019s interdisciplinary use of open-source software provides a unique example of local innovation while at the same time presenting a case for how scientific institutions such as the LNCC continue to support its platforms and projects despite state-wide budget cuts. In this case, I argue that epistemological dependency in Brazilian scientific knowledge production rests not on conventional assumptions of failed technology transfer, but rather, on the local government\u2019s history of obstructing the progress of local scientific endeavors.\"\u00a0\nBiography:\nBeatrice Choi is a Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern University and a Predoctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania.\u00a0Her research examines innovation culture in Brazil. In her dissertation, she studies how histories of scientific enterprise and technological adoption during the countries\u2019 colonial and authoritarian periods influence present innovation initiatives. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, she maps a historical genealogy to document the rise of the Brazilian technocratic elite. She dovetails these historical accounts with ethnographic observation\u2014at a makerspace, a computer graphics research institute, and a national scientific laboratory, respectively\u2014to provide an intergenerational analysis of innovation. Choi received her Bachelor of Arts in Communication and International Studies at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and her Masters of Arts in Media Culture and Communication at New York University (NYU).

He successfully defended his dissertation, entitled \"Politics as Sport: The Effects of Partisan Media on Perceptions of Electoral Integrity,\" at ASC in December 2016. Prior to arriving for the Annenberg Ph.D. program, Daniller completed his Master\u2019s degree in Media and Public Affairs at the George Washington University and Bachelor\u2019s degrees in Government & Politics and Economics at the University of Maryland.\nDaniller's\u00a0research focuses on the role of media in shaping citizens\u2019 trust of democratic institutions and processes. His dissertation research demonstrates that exposure to like-minded partisan media exacerbates the distrust of the electoral process typically felt by voters who supported a losing candidate or party. The reemergence of partisan media in the United States therefore appears to undermine support for elections themselves.\nDaniller's work has appeared in Nature, Electoral Studies, and Communication Methods and Measures. Additionally, he has been invited to present his research as a speaker in the Provost\u2019s Year of Media program at the University of Pennsylvania and in the Beyond the Classroom series at the University of St. Thomas. Daniller was recently awarded the prize for top student paper in the annual competition conducted by the PA/NJ chapter of the American Association for Public Opinion Research. He currently teaches the undergraduate course Media and Political Trust at the University of Pennsylvania. He has previously taught Public Opinion and American Democracy (Spring 2017) and Introduction to Communication Behavior (Summer 2014) at Penn, as well as Fundamentals of Communication and Media Studies (Fall 2016, Spring 2017) at Fordham University.\nAs a Gerbner Fellow, Daniller is pursuing a detailed content analysis of the ways in which television news and public affairs programs explain the results of elections to their viewers. He plans to combine the resulting analysis with his dissertation research to produce a book manuscript that thoroughly explores the ways in which partisan media shape citizens\u2019 understanding of and trust in election results.", "endtime": "1:00pm", "event_id": "", "location": "Location:\u00a0Annenberg School Room 500", "owner": "Annenberg School of Communication", "speaker": "", "starttime": "12:00pm", "summary": "", "title": "George Gerbner Postdoctoral Fellow Colloquium: Andrew Daniller (Ph.D. '17)", "url": "https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/events/andrew-daniller-george-gerbner-postdoctoral-fellow-talk", "date_dt": "22-03-2019"}

They helped make that night the last time he assaulted me. Intervening in an abusive relationship can be dangerous, challenging work for police, advocates, family and friends. But victims usually can't leave without community intervention and support. Police who know what to say and how to help a victim reeling from abuse are invaluable. Thank you to all the police officers who respond to 911 calls from abuse victims. Your work matters. Your work saved my life.\"", "endtime": "", "event_id": "", "location": "", "owner": "Ortner Center for Violence and Abuse in Relationships", "speaker": "", "starttime": "", "summary": "", "title": "Leslie Morgan Steiner: Thank You to the Police Who Helped Me Leave My Abusive Husband - Nov. 10, 2017", "url": "http://ortnercenter.org/updates/2017/11/10/leslie-morgan-steiner-thank-you-to-the-police-who-helped-me-leave-my-abusive-husband", "date_dt": "10-11-2017"}
