# Events at the University of Pennsylvania

All events happening at the University of Pennsylvania event with built-in search and recommendation engine.

### Backend

We use Python as our backend. Backend mainly contains scripts to fetch events from Penn, search and recommendation API using [hug](https://www.hug.rest/), 
and index fetched events to `elasticsearch`. The hug backend is set by default to run on port `8888` and elasticsearch is run on port `9200`. 
See `backend` folder on how to run the backend scripts.


### Frontend

We use react-js as a frontend. The frontend is located in `gatsby_site` folder. 
Before running, make sure that you have recent version of `npm` installed (NodeJS 8+).
If it is the first time, you need to install `gatsby-cli`.

```sh
# only once on first time
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

and run front-end application from the `gatsby_site` folder as follows:

```sh
cd gatsby_site
npm install
gatsby develop
```

This will run Gatsby frontend site on port `8000`.
