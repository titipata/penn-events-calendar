# Events at the University of Pennsylvania

A web application that collects all events happening at the University of Pennsylvania with built-in search and recommendation engine.

## Run web application

We use [`Gatsby.js`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) as our frontend. The frontend is located in `gatsby_site` folder. Before running, make sure that you have a recent version of `npm` installed (NodeJS 8+). If it is the first time, you need to install `gatsby-cli`.

```sh
# only once on first time
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

and run frontend application from the [`gatsby_site`](https://github.com/titipata/penn-events-calendar/tree/master/gatsby_site) folder as follows:

```sh
cd gatsby_site
npm install
npm start
```

Then index given example data to ElasticSearch located in [`backend/data`](https://github.com/titipata/penn-events-calendar/tree/master/backend/data) using:

```sh
npm run index-elastic # index data to elasticsearch
```

By default, this will concurrently run Gatsby frontend site at port `8000`, hug API backend at port `8888`, and ElasticSearch at port `9200`. For deployment, use `npm run deploy` instead. This will run the site at port `9000`. See [`gatsby_site`](https://github.com/titipata/penn-events-calendar/tree/master/gatsby_site#running-on-remote-server), to see how to run on a remote server.

**For production** see [`devops`](https://github.com/titipata/penn-events-calendar/tree/master/devops) folder on how to set up [supervisord](http://supervisord.org).
